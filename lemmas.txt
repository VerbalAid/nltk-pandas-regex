preface
a
few
word
about
dostoevsky
himself
may
help
the
english
reader
to
understand
his
work
dostoevsky
wa
the
son
of
a
doctor
his
parent
were
very
and
deeply
religious
people
but
so
poor
that
they
lived
with
their
five
child
in
only
two
room
the
father
and
mother
spent
their
evening
in
reading
aloud
to
their
child
generally
from
book
of
a
serious
character
though
always
sickly
and
delicate
dostoevsky
came
out
third
in
the
final
examination
of
the
petersburg
school
of
engineering
there
he
had
already
begun
his
first
work
poor
this
story
wa
published
by
the
poet
nekrassov
in
his
review
and
wa
received
with
acclamation
the
shy
unknown
youth
found
himself
instantly
something
of
a
celebrity
a
brilliant
and
successful
career
seemed
to
open
before
him
but
those
hope
were
soon
dashed
in
he
wa
arrested
though
neither
by
temperament
nor
conviction
a
revolutionist
dostoevsky
wa
one
of
a
little
group
of
young
men
who
met
together
to
read
fourier
and
proudhon
he
wa
accused
of
taking
part
in
conversation
against
the
censorship
of
reading
a
letter
from
byelinsky
to
gogol
and
of
knowing
of
the
intention
to
set
up
a
printing
under
nicholas
i
that
stern
and
just
man
a
maurice
baring
call
him
this
wa
enough
and
he
wa
condemned
to
death
after
eight
month
imprisonment
he
wa
with
others
taken
out
to
the
semyonovsky
square
to
be
shot
writing
to
his
brother
mihail
dostoevsky
say
they
snapped
word
over
our
head
and
they
made
u
put
on
the
white
shirt
worn
by
person
condemned
to
death
thereupon
we
were
bound
in
three
to
stake
to
suffer
execution
being
the
third
in
the
row
i
concluded
i
had
only
a
few
minute
of
life
before
me
i
thought
of
you
and
your
dear
one
and
i
contrived
to
kiss
plestcheiev
and
dourov
who
were
next
to
me
and
to
bid
them
farewell
suddenly
the
troop
beat
a
tattoo
we
were
unbound
brought
back
upon
the
scaffold
and
informed
that
his
majesty
had
spared
u
our
the
sentence
wa
commuted
to
hard
labour
one
of
the
prisoner
grigoryev
went
mad
a
soon
a
he
wa
untied
and
never
regained
his
sanity
the
intense
suffering
of
this
experience
left
a
lasting
stamp
on
dostoevsky
s
mind
though
his
religious
temper
led
him
in
the
end
to
accept
every
suffering
with
resignation
and
to
regard
it
a
a
blessing
in
his
own
case
he
constantly
recurs
to
the
subject
in
his
writing
he
describes
the
awful
agony
of
the
condemned
man
and
insists
on
the
cruelty
of
inflicting
such
torture
then
followed
four
year
of
penal
servitude
spent
in
the
company
of
common
criminal
in
siberia
where
he
began
the
dead
house
and
some
year
of
service
in
a
disciplinary
battalion
he
had
shown
sign
of
some
obscure
nervous
disease
before
his
arrest
and
this
now
developed
into
violent
attack
of
epilepsy
from
which
he
suffered
for
the
rest
of
his
life
the
fit
occurred
three
or
four
time
a
year
and
were
more
frequent
in
period
of
great
strain
in
he
wa
allowed
to
return
to
russia
he
started
a
journal
vremya
which
wa
forbidden
by
the
censorship
through
a
misunderstanding
in
he
lost
his
first
wife
and
his
brother
mihail
he
wa
in
terrible
poverty
yet
he
took
upon
himself
the
payment
of
his
brother
s
debt
he
started
another
journal
the
epoch
which
within
a
few
month
wa
also
prohibited
he
wa
weighed
down
by
debt
his
brother
s
family
wa
dependent
on
him
he
wa
forced
to
write
at
speed
and
is
said
never
to
have
corrected
his
work
the
later
year
of
his
life
were
much
softened
by
the
tenderness
and
devotion
of
his
second
wife
in
june
he
made
his
famous
speech
at
the
unveiling
of
the
monument
to
pushkin
in
moscow
and
he
wa
received
with
extraordinary
demonstration
of
love
and
honour
a
few
month
later
dostoevsky
died
he
wa
followed
to
the
grave
by
a
vast
multitude
of
mourner
who
gave
the
hapless
man
the
funeral
of
a
he
is
still
probably
the
most
widely
read
writer
in
russia
in
the
word
of
a
russian
critic
who
seek
to
explain
the
feeling
inspired
by
dostoevsky
he
wa
one
of
ourselves
a
man
of
our
blood
and
our
bone
but
one
who
ha
suffered
and
ha
seen
so
much
more
deeply
than
we
have
his
insight
impress
u
a
wisdom
that
wisdom
of
the
heart
which
we
seek
that
we
may
learn
from
it
how
to
live
all
his
other
gift
came
to
him
from
nature
this
he
won
for
himself
and
through
it
he
became
crime
and
punishment
part
i
chapter
i
on
an
exceptionally
hot
evening
early
in
july
a
young
man
came
out
of
the
garret
in
which
he
lodged
in
place
and
walked
slowly
a
though
in
hesitation
towards
bridge
he
had
successfully
avoided
meeting
his
landlady
on
the
staircase
his
garret
wa
under
the
roof
of
a
high
house
and
wa
more
like
a
cupboard
than
a
room
the
landlady
who
provided
him
with
garret
dinner
and
attendance
lived
on
the
floor
below
and
every
time
he
went
out
he
wa
obliged
to
pas
her
kitchen
the
door
of
which
invariably
stood
open
and
each
time
he
passed
the
young
man
had
a
sick
frightened
feeling
which
made
him
scowl
and
feel
ashamed
he
wa
hopelessly
in
debt
to
his
landlady
and
wa
afraid
of
meeting
her
this
wa
not
because
he
wa
cowardly
and
abject
quite
the
contrary
but
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
in
an
overstrained
irritable
condition
verging
on
hypochondria
he
had
become
so
completely
absorbed
in
himself
and
isolated
from
his
fellow
that
he
dreaded
meeting
not
only
his
landlady
but
anyone
at
all
he
wa
crushed
by
poverty
but
the
anxiety
of
his
position
had
of
late
ceased
to
weigh
upon
him
he
had
given
up
attending
to
matter
of
practical
importance
he
had
lost
all
desire
to
do
so
nothing
that
any
landlady
could
do
had
a
real
terror
for
him
but
to
be
stopped
on
the
stair
to
be
forced
to
listen
to
her
trivial
irrelevant
gossip
to
pestering
demand
for
payment
threat
and
complaint
and
to
rack
his
brain
for
excuse
to
prevaricate
to
lie
no
rather
than
that
he
would
creep
down
the
stair
like
a
cat
and
slip
out
unseen
this
evening
however
on
coming
out
into
the
street
he
became
acutely
aware
of
his
fear
i
want
to
attempt
a
thing
and
am
frightened
by
these
trifle
he
thought
with
an
odd
smile
hm
yes
all
is
in
a
man
s
hand
and
he
let
it
all
slip
from
cowardice
that
s
an
axiom
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
it
is
men
are
most
afraid
of
taking
a
new
step
uttering
a
new
word
is
what
they
fear
most
but
i
am
talking
too
much
it
s
because
i
chatter
that
i
do
nothing
or
perhaps
it
is
that
i
chatter
because
i
do
nothing
i
ve
learned
to
chatter
this
last
month
lying
for
day
together
in
my
den
thinking
of
jack
the
why
am
i
going
there
now
am
i
capable
of
is
serious
it
is
not
serious
at
all
it
s
simply
a
fantasy
to
amuse
myself
a
plaything
yes
maybe
it
is
a
the
heat
in
the
street
wa
terrible
and
the
airlessness
the
bustle
and
the
plaster
scaffolding
brick
and
dust
all
about
him
and
that
special
petersburg
stench
so
familiar
to
all
who
are
unable
to
get
out
of
town
in
summer
all
worked
painfully
upon
the
young
man
s
already
overwrought
nerve
the
insufferable
stench
from
the
which
are
particularly
numerous
in
that
part
of
the
town
and
the
drunken
men
whom
he
met
continually
although
it
wa
a
working
day
completed
the
revolting
misery
of
the
picture
an
expression
of
the
profoundest
disgust
gleamed
for
a
moment
in
the
young
man
s
refined
face
he
wa
by
the
way
exceptionally
handsome
above
the
average
in
height
slim
with
beautiful
dark
eye
and
dark
brown
hair
soon
he
sank
into
deep
thought
or
more
accurately
speaking
into
a
complete
blankness
of
mind
he
walked
along
not
observing
what
wa
about
him
and
not
caring
to
observe
it
from
time
to
time
he
would
mutter
something
from
the
habit
of
talking
to
himself
to
which
he
had
just
confessed
at
these
moment
he
would
become
conscious
that
his
idea
were
sometimes
in
a
tangle
and
that
he
wa
very
weak
for
two
day
he
had
scarcely
tasted
food
he
wa
so
badly
dressed
that
even
a
man
accustomed
to
shabbiness
would
have
been
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
in
such
rag
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
however
scarcely
any
shortcoming
in
dress
would
have
created
surprise
owing
to
the
proximity
of
the
hay
market
the
number
of
establishment
of
bad
character
the
preponderance
of
the
trading
and
working
class
population
crowded
in
these
street
and
alley
in
the
heart
of
petersburg
type
so
various
were
to
be
seen
in
the
street
that
no
figure
however
queer
would
have
caused
surprise
but
there
wa
such
accumulated
bitterness
and
contempt
in
the
young
man
s
heart
that
in
spite
of
all
the
fastidiousness
of
youth
he
minded
his
rag
least
of
all
in
the
street
it
wa
a
different
matter
when
he
met
with
acquaintance
or
with
former
fellow
student
whom
indeed
he
disliked
meeting
at
any
time
and
yet
when
a
drunken
man
who
for
some
unknown
reason
wa
being
taken
somewhere
in
a
huge
waggon
dragged
by
a
heavy
dray
horse
suddenly
shouted
at
him
a
he
drove
past
hey
there
german
hatter
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
pointing
at
him
the
young
man
stopped
suddenly
and
clutched
tremulously
at
his
hat
it
wa
a
tall
round
hat
from
zimmerman
s
but
completely
worn
out
rusty
with
age
all
torn
and
bespattered
brimless
and
bent
on
one
side
in
a
most
unseemly
fashion
not
shame
however
but
quite
another
feeling
akin
to
terror
had
overtaken
him
i
knew
it
he
muttered
in
confusion
i
thought
so
that
s
the
worst
of
all
why
a
stupid
thing
like
this
the
most
trivial
detail
might
spoil
the
whole
plan
yes
my
hat
is
too
noticeable
it
look
absurd
and
that
make
it
noticeable
with
my
rag
i
ought
to
wear
a
cap
any
sort
of
old
pancake
but
not
this
grotesque
thing
nobody
wear
such
a
hat
it
would
be
noticed
a
mile
off
it
would
be
remembered
what
matter
is
that
people
would
remember
it
and
that
would
give
them
a
clue
for
this
business
one
should
be
a
little
conspicuous
a
possible
trifle
trifle
are
what
matter
why
it
s
just
such
trifle
that
always
ruin
everything
he
had
not
far
to
go
he
knew
indeed
how
many
step
it
wa
from
the
gate
of
his
lodging
house
exactly
seven
hundred
and
thirty
he
had
counted
them
once
when
he
had
been
lost
in
dream
at
the
time
he
had
put
no
faith
in
those
dream
and
wa
only
tantalising
himself
by
their
hideous
but
daring
recklessness
now
a
month
later
he
had
begun
to
look
upon
them
differently
and
in
spite
of
the
monologue
in
which
he
jeered
at
his
own
impotence
and
indecision
he
had
involuntarily
come
to
regard
this
hideous
dream
a
an
exploit
to
be
attempted
although
he
still
did
not
realise
this
himself
he
wa
positively
going
now
for
a
rehearsal
of
his
project
and
at
every
step
his
excitement
grew
more
and
more
violent
with
a
sinking
heart
and
a
nervous
tremor
he
went
up
to
a
huge
house
which
on
one
side
looked
on
to
the
canal
and
on
the
other
into
the
street
this
house
wa
let
out
in
tiny
tenement
and
wa
inhabited
by
working
people
of
all
kind

etc
there
wa
a
continual
coming
and
going
through
the
two
gate
and
in
the
two
courtyard
of
the
house
three
or
four
were
employed
on
the
building
the
young
man
wa
very
glad
to
meet
none
of
them
and
at
once
slipped
unnoticed
through
the
door
on
the
right
and
up
the
staircase
it
wa
a
back
staircase
dark
and
narrow
but
he
wa
familiar
with
it
already
and
knew
his
way
and
he
liked
all
these
surroundings
in
such
darkness
even
the
most
inquisitive
eye
were
not
to
be
dreaded
if
i
am
so
scared
now
what
would
it
be
if
it
somehow
came
to
pas
that
i
were
really
going
to
do
it
he
could
not
help
asking
himself
a
he
reached
the
fourth
storey
there
his
progress
wa
barred
by
some
porter
who
were
engaged
in
moving
furniture
out
of
a
flat
he
knew
that
the
flat
had
been
occupied
by
a
german
clerk
in
the
civil
service
and
his
family
this
german
wa
moving
out
then
and
so
the
fourth
floor
on
this
staircase
would
be
untenanted
except
by
the
old
woman
that
s
a
good
thing
anyway
he
thought
to
himself
a
he
rang
the
bell
of
the
old
woman
s
flat
the
bell
gave
a
faint
tinkle
a
though
it
were
made
of
tin
and
not
of
copper
the
little
flat
in
such
house
always
have
bell
that
ring
like
that
he
had
forgotten
the
note
of
that
bell
and
now
it
peculiar
tinkle
seemed
to
remind
him
of
something
and
to
bring
it
clearly
before
him
he
started
his
nerve
were
terribly
overstrained
by
now
in
a
little
while
the
door
wa
opened
a
tiny
crack
the
old
woman
eyed
her
visitor
with
evident
distrust
through
the
crack
and
nothing
could
be
seen
but
her
little
eye
glittering
in
the
darkness
but
seeing
a
number
of
people
on
the
landing
she
grew
bolder
and
opened
the
door
wide
the
young
man
stepped
into
the
dark
entry
which
wa
partitioned
off
from
the
tiny
kitchen
the
old
woman
stood
facing
him
in
silence
and
looking
inquiringly
at
him
she
wa
a
diminutive
withered
up
old
woman
of
sixty
with
sharp
malignant
eye
and
a
sharp
little
nose
her
colourless
somewhat
grizzled
hair
wa
thickly
smeared
with
oil
and
she
wore
no
kerchief
over
it
round
her
thin
long
neck
which
looked
like
a
hen
s
leg
wa
knotted
some
sort
of
flannel
rag
and
in
spite
of
the
heat
there
hung
flapping
on
her
shoulder
a
mangy
fur
cape
yellow
with
age
the
old
woman
coughed
and
groaned
at
every
instant
the
young
man
must
have
looked
at
her
with
a
rather
peculiar
expression
for
a
gleam
of
mistrust
came
into
her
eye
again

student
i
came
here
a
month
ago
the
young
man
made
haste
to
mutter
with
a
half
bow
remembering
that
he
ought
to
be
more
polite
i
remember
my
good
sir
i
remember
quite
well
your
coming
here
the
old
woman
said
distinctly
still
keeping
her
inquiring
eye
on
his
face
and
here
i
am
again
on
the
same
errand
raskolnikov
continued
a
little
disconcerted
and
surprised
at
the
old
woman
s
mistrust
perhaps
she
is
always
like
that
though
only
i
did
not
notice
it
the
other
time
he
thought
with
an
uneasy
feeling
the
old
woman
paused
a
though
hesitating
then
stepped
on
one
side
and
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
room
she
said
letting
her
visitor
pas
in

of

step
in

too

a
it
were
by
chance
through
raskolnikov
s
mind
and
with
a
rapid
glance
he
scanned
everything
in
the
room
trying
a
far
a
possible
to
notice
and
remember
it
arrangement
but
there
wa
nothing
special
in
the
room
the
furniture
all
very
old
and
of
yellow
wood
consisted
of
a
sofa
with
a
huge
bent
wooden
back
an
oval
table
in

of
the

there

in

house
of
spiteful
old
widow
that
one
find
such
cleanliness
raskolnikov
thought
again
and
he
stole
a
curious
glance
at
the
cotton
curtain
over
the
door
leading
into
another
tiny
room
in
which
stood
the
old
woman
s
bed
and
chest
of
drawer
and
into
which
he
had
never
looked
before
these
two
room
made
up
the
whole
flat
what
do
you
want
the
old
woman
said
severely
coming
into
the
room
and
a
before
standing
in
front
of
him
so
a
to
look
him
straight
in
the
face
i
ve
brought
something
to
pawn
here
and
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
an
flat
silver
watch
on
the
back
of
which
wa
engraved
a
globe

of

rouble

and

a
rouble
and
a
half
cried
the
young
man
please
yourself
and
the
old
woman
handed
him
back
the
watch
the
young
man
took
it
and
wa
so
angry
that
he
wa
on
the
point
of
going
away
but
checked
himself
at
once
remembering
that
there
wa
nowhere
else
he
could
go
and
that
he
had
had
another
object
also
in
coming
hand
it
over
he
said
roughly
the
old
woman
fumbled
in
her
pocket
for
her
key
and
disappeared
behind
the
curtain
into
the
other
room
the
young
man
left
standing
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listened
inquisitively
thinking
he
could
hear
her
unlocking
the
chest
of
drawer
it
must
be
the
top
drawer
he
reflected
so
she
carry
the
key
in
a
pocket
on
the
right
all
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
and
there
s
one
key
there
three
time
a
big
a
all
the
others
with
deep
notch
that
can
t
be
the
key
of
the
chest
of
drawer
then
there
must
be
some
other
chest
or
that
s
worth
knowing
always
have
key
like
that
but
how
degrading
it
all
the
old
woman
came
back
here

we
say
ten
copeck

rouble
a
month

i
must

and
fifteen
copeck
for
the
watch
here

what
only
a
rouble
and
fifteen
copeck
now
just
the
young
man
did
not
dispute
it
and
took
the
money
he
looked
at
the
old
woman
and
wa
in
no
hurry
to
get
away
a
though
there
wa
still
something
he
wanted
to
say
or
to
do
but
he
did
not
himself
quite
know
what
i
may
be
bringing
you
something
else
in
a
day
or
two
alyona
ivanovna
a
valuable
thing
silver
a
a
soon
a
i
get
it
back
from
a
friend
he
broke
off
in
confusion
well
we
will
talk
about
it
then
are
you
always
at
home
alone
your
sister
is
not
here
with
you
he
asked
her
a
casually
a
possible
a
he
went
out
into
the
passage
what
business
is
she
of
yours
my
good
sir
oh
nothing
particular
i
simply
asked
you
are
too
quick
alyona
raskolnikov
went
out
in
complete
confusion
this
confusion
became
more
and
more
intense
a
he
went
down
the
stair
he
even
stopped
short
two
or
three
time
a
though
suddenly
struck
by
some
thought
when
he
wa
in
the
street
he
cried
out
oh
god
how
loathsome
it
all
is
and
can
i
can
i
possibly
no
it
s
nonsense
it
s
rubbish
he
added
resolutely
and
how
could
such
an
atrocious
thing
come
into
my
head
what
filthy
thing
my
heart
is
capable
of
yes
filthy
above
all
disgusting
loathsome
loathsome
and
for
a
whole
month
i
ve
been
but
no
word
no
exclamation
could
express
his
agitation
the
feeling
of
intense
repulsion
which
had
begun
to
oppress
and
torture
his
heart
while
he
wa
on
his
way
to
the
old
woman
had
by
now
reached
such
a
pitch
and
had
taken
such
a
definite
form
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
to
escape
from
his
wretchedness
he
walked
along
the
pavement
like
a
drunken
man
regardless
of
the
and
jostling
against
them
and
only
came
to
his
sens
when
he
wa
in
the
next
street
looking
round
he
noticed
that
he
wa
standing
close
to
a
tavern
which
wa
entered
by
step
leading
from
the
pavement
to
the
basement
at
that
instant
two
drunken
men
came
out
at
the
door
and
abusing
and
supporting
one
another
they
mounted
the
step
without
stopping
to
think
raskolnikov
went
down
the
step
at
once
till
that
moment
he
had
never
been
into
a
tavern
but
now
he
felt
giddy
and
wa
tormented
by
a
burning
thirst
he
longed
for
a
drink
of
cold
beer
and
attributed
his
sudden
weakness
to
the
want
of
food
he
sat
down
at
a
sticky
little
table
in
a
dark
and
dirty
corner
ordered
some
beer
and
eagerly
drank
off
the
first
glassful
at
once
he
felt
easier
and
his
thought
became
clear
all
that
s
nonsense
he
said
hopefully
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
all
to
worry
about
it
s
simply
physical
derangement
just
a
glass
of
beer
a
piece
of
dry
bread
and
in
one
moment
the
brain
is
stronger
the
mind
is
clearer
and
the
will
is
firm
phew
how
utterly
petty
it
all
is
but
in
spite
of
this
scornful
reflection
he
wa
by
now
looking
cheerful
a
though
he
were
suddenly
set
free
from
a
terrible
burden
and
he
gazed
round
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
people
in
the
room
but
even
at
that
moment
he
had
a
dim
foreboding
that
this
happier
frame
of
mind
wa
also
not
normal
there
were
few
people
at
the
time
in
the
tavern
besides
the
two
drunken
men
he
had
met
on
the
step
a
group
consisting
of
about
five
men
and
a
girl
with
a
concertina
had
gone
out
at
the
same
time
their
departure
left
the
room
quiet
and
rather
empty
the
person
still
in
the
tavern
were
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
an
artisan
drunk
but
not
extremely
so
sitting
before
a
pot
of
beer
and
his
companion
a
huge
stout
man
with
a
grey
beard
in
a
short
coat
he
wa
very
drunk
and
had
dropped
asleep
on
the
bench
every
now
and
then
he
began
a
though
in
his
sleep
cracking
his
finger
with
his
arm
wide
apart
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
bounding
about
on
the
bench
while
he
hummed
some
meaningless
refrain
trying
to
recall
some
such
line
a
these
his
wife
a

his
wife

a
year
he
fondly
or
suddenly
waking
up
again
walking
along
the
crowded
row
he
met
the
one
he
used
to
but
no
one
shared
his
enjoyment
his
silent
companion
looked
with
positive
hostility
and
mistrust
at
all
these
manifestation
there
wa
another
man
in
the
room
who
looked
somewhat
like
a
retired
government
clerk
he
wa
sitting
apart
now
and
then
sipping
from
his
pot
and
looking
round
at
the
company
he
too
appeared
to
be
in
some
agitation
chapter
ii
raskolnikov
wa
not
used
to
crowd
and
a
we
said
before
he
avoided
society
of
every
sort
more
especially
of
late
but
now
all
at
once
he
felt
a
desire
to
be
with
other
people
something
new
seemed
to
be
taking
place
within
him
and
with
it
he
felt
a
sort
of
thirst
for
company
he
wa
so
weary
after
a
whole
month
of
concentrated
wretchedness
and
gloomy
excitement
that
he
longed
to
rest
if
only
for
a
moment
in
some
other
world
whatever
it
might
be
and
in
spite
of
the
filthiness
of
the
surroundings
he
wa
glad
now
to
stay
in
the
tavern
the
master
of
the
establishment
wa
in
another
room
but
he
frequently
came
down
some
step
into
the
main
room
his
jaunty
tarred
boot
with
red
top
coming
into
view
each
time
before
the
rest
of
his
person
he
wore
a
full
coat
and
a
horribly
greasy
black
satin
waistcoat
with
no
cravat
and
his
whole
face
seemed
smeared
with
oil
like
an
iron
lock
at
the
counter
stood
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
and
there
wa
another
boy
somewhat
younger
who
handed
whatever
wa
wanted
on
the
counter
lay
some
sliced
cucumber
some
piece
of
dried
black
bread
and
some
fish
chopped
up
small
all
smelling
very
bad
it
wa
insufferably
close
and
so
heavy
with
the
fume
of
spirit
that
five
minute
in
such
an
atmosphere
might
well
make
a
man
drunk
there
are
chance
meeting
with
stranger
that
interest
u
from
the
first
moment
before
a
word
is
spoken
such
wa
the
impression
made
on
raskolnikov
by
the
person
sitting
a
little
distance
from
him
who
looked
like
a
retired
clerk
the
young
man
often
recalled
this
impression
afterwards
and
even
ascribed
it
to
presentiment
he
looked
repeatedly
at
the
clerk
partly
no
doubt
because
the
latter
wa
staring
persistently
at
him
obviously
anxious
to
enter
into
conversation
at
the
other
person
in
the
room
including
the
the
clerk
looked
a
though
he
were
used
to
their
company
and
weary
of
it
showing
a
shade
of
condescending
contempt
for
them
a
person
of
station
and
culture
inferior
to
his
own
with
whom
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
converse
he
wa
a
man
over
fifty
bald
and
grizzled
of
medium
height
and
stoutly
built
his
face
bloated
from
continual
drinking
wa
of
a
yellow
even
greenish
tinge
with
swollen
eyelid
out
of
which
keen
reddish
eye
gleamed
like
little
chink
but
there
wa
something
very
strange
in
him
there
wa
a
light
in
his
eye
a
though
of
intense
feeling
perhaps
there
were
even
thought
and
intelligence
but
at
the
same
time
there
wa
a
gleam
of
something
like
madness
he
wa
wearing
an
old
and
hopelessly
ragged
black
dress
coat
with
all
it
button
missing
except
one
and
that
one
he
had
buttoned
evidently
clinging
to
this
last
trace
of
respectability
a
crumpled
shirt
front
covered
with
spot
and
stain
protruded
from
his
canvas
waistcoat
like
a
clerk
he
wore
no
beard
nor
moustache
but
had
been
so
long
unshaven
that
his
chin
looked
like
a
stiff
greyish
brush
and
there
wa
something
respectable
and
like
an
official
about
his
manner
too
but
he
wa
restless
he
ruffled
up
his
hair
and
from
time
to
time
let
his
head
drop
into
his
hand
dejectedly
resting
his
ragged
elbow
on
the
stained
and
sticky
table
at
last
he
looked
straight
at
raskolnikov
and
said
loudly
and
resolutely
may
i
venture
honoured
sir
to
engage
you
in
polite
conversation
forasmuch
a
though
your
exterior
would
not
command
respect
my
experience
admonishes
me
that
you
are
a
man
of
education
and
not
accustomed
to
drinking
i
have
always
respected
education
when
in
conjunction
with
genuine
sentiment
and
i
am
besides
a
titular
counsellor
in
rank
marmeladov
such
is
my
name
titular
counsellor
i
make
bold
to
inquire
have
you
been
in
the
service
no
i
am
studying
answered
the
young
man
somewhat
surprised
at
the
grandiloquent
style
of
the
speaker
and
also
at
being
so
directly
addressed
in
spite
of
the
momentary
desire
he
had
just
been
feeling
for
company
of
any
sort
on
being
actually
spoken
to
he
felt
immediately
his
habitual
irritable
and
uneasy
aversion
for
any
stranger
who
approached
or
attempted
to
approach
him
a
student
then
or
formerly
a
student
cried
the
clerk
just
what
i
thought
i
m
a
man
of
experience
immense
experience
sir
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
with
his
finger
in
you
ve
been
a
student
or
have
attended
some
learned
institution
but
allow
me
he
got
up
staggered
took
up
his
jug
and
glass
and
sat
down
beside
the
young
man
facing
him
a
little
sideways
he
wa
drunk
but
spoke
fluently
and
boldly
only
occasionally
losing
the
thread
of
his
sentence
and
drawling
his
word
he
pounced
upon
raskolnikov
a
greedily
a
though
he
too
had
not
spoken
to
a
soul
for
a
month
honoured
sir
he
began
almost
with
solemnity
poverty
is
not
a
vice
that
s
a
true
saying
yet
i
know
too
that
drunkenness
is
not
a
virtue
and
that
that
s
even
truer
but
beggary
honoured
sir
beggary
is
a
vice
in
poverty
you
may
still
retain
your
innate
nobility
of
soul
but
in
beggary
never
no
one
for
beggary
a
man
is
not
chased
out
of
human
society
with
a
stick
he
is
swept
out
with
a
broom
so
a
to
make
it
a
humiliating
a
possible
and
quite
right
too
forasmuch
a
in
beggary
i
am
ready
to
be
the
first
to
humiliate
myself
hence
the
honoured
sir
a
month
ago
lebeziatnikov
gave
my
wife
a
beating
and
my
wife
is
a
very
different
matter
from
me
do
you
understand
allow
me
to
ask
you
another
question
out
of
simple
curiosity
have
you
ever
spent
a
night
on
a
hay
barge
on
the
neva
no
i
have
not
happened
to
answered
raskolnikov
what
do
you
mean
well
i
ve
just
come
from
one
and
it
s
the
fifth
night
i
ve
slept
so
he
filled
his
glass
emptied
it
and
paused
bit
of
hay
were
in
fact
clinging
to
his
clothes
and
sticking
to
his
hair
it
seemed
quite
probable
that
he
had
not
undressed
or
washed
for
the
last
five
day
his
hand
particularly
were
filthy
they
were
fat
and
red
with
black
nail
his
conversation
seemed
to
excite
a
general
though
languid
interest
the
boy
at
the
counter
fell
to
sniggering
the
innkeeper
came
down
from
the
upper
room
apparently
on
purpose
to
listen
to
the
funny
fellow
and
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
yawning
lazily
but
with
dignity
evidently
marmeladov
wa
a
familiar
figure
here
and
he
had
most
likely
acquired
his
weakness
for
speech
from
the
habit
of
frequently
entering
into
conversation
with
stranger
of
all
sort
in
the
tavern
this
habit
develops
into
a
necessity
in
some
drunkard
and
especially
in
those
who
are
looked
after
sharply
and
kept
in
order
at
home
hence
in
the
company
of
other
drinker
they
try
to
justify
themselves
and
even
if
possible
obtain
consideration
funny
fellow
pronounced
the
innkeeper
and
why
don
t
you
work
why
aren
t
you
at
your
duty
if
you
are
in
the
service
why
am
i
not
at
my
duty
honoured
sir
marmeladov
went
on
addressing
himself
exclusively
to
raskolnikov
a
though
it
had
been
he
who
put
that
question
to
him
why
am
i
not
at
my
duty
doe
not
my
heart
ache
to
think
what
a
useless
worm
i
am
a
month
ago
when
lebeziatnikov
beat
my
wife
with
his
own
hand
and
i
lay
drunk
didn
t
i
suffer
excuse
me
young
man
ha
it
ever
happened
to
you
hm
well
to
petition
hopelessly
for
a
loan
yes
it
ha
but
what
do
you
mean
by
hopelessly
hopelessly
in
the
fullest
sense
when
you
know
beforehand
that
you
will
get
nothing
by
it
you
know
for
instance
beforehand
with
positive
certainty
that
this
man
this
most
reputable
and
exemplary
citizen
will
on
no
consideration
give
you
money
and
indeed
i
ask
you
why
should
he
for
he
know
of
course
that
i
shan
t
pay
it
back
from
compassion
but
lebeziatnikov
who
keep
up
with
modern
idea
explained
the
other
day
that
compassion
is
forbidden
nowadays
by
science
itself
and
that
that
s
what
is
done
now
in
england
where
there
is
political
economy
why
i
ask
you
should
he
give
it
to
me
and
yet
though
i
know
beforehand
that
he
won
t
i
set
off
to
him
and
why
do
you
go
put
in
raskolnikov
well
when
one
ha
no
one
nowhere
else
one
can
go
for
every
man
must
have
somewhere
to
go
since
there
are
time
when
one
absolutely
must
go
somewhere
when
my
own
daughter
first
went
out
with
a
yellow
ticket
then
i
had
to
go
for
my
daughter
ha
a
yellow
passport
he
added
in
parenthesis
looking
with
a
certain
uneasiness
at
the
young
man
no
matter
sir
no
matter
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
with
apparent
composure
when
both
the
boy
at
the
counter
guffawed
and
even
the
innkeeper
smiled
no
matter
i
am
not
confounded
by
the
wagging
of
their
head
for
everyone
know
everything
about
it
already
and
all
that
is
secret
is
made
open
and
i
accept
it
all
not
with
contempt
but
with
humility
so
be
it
so
be
it
behold
the
man
excuse
me
young
man
can
you
no
to
put
it
more
strongly
and
more
distinctly
not
you
but
you
looking
upon
me
assert
that
i
am
not
a
pig
the
young
man
did
not
answer
a
word
well
the
orator
began
again
stolidly
and
with
even
increased
dignity
after
waiting
for
the
laughter
in
the
room
to
subside
well
so
be
it
i
am
a
pig
but
she
is
a
lady
i
have
the
semblance
of
a
beast
but
katerina
ivanovna
my
spouse
is
a
person
of
education
and
an
officer

daughter
granted
granted
i
am
a
scoundrel
but
she
is
a
woman
of
a
noble
heart
full
of
sentiment
refined
by
education
and
yet
oh
if

she
felt
for
me
honoured

honoured
sir
you
know
every
man
ought
to
have
at
least
one
place
where
people
feel
for
him
but
katerina
ivanovna
though
she
is
magnanimous
she
is
unjust
and
yet
although
i
realise
that
when
she
pull
my
hair
she
only
doe
it
out
of
pity
for

repeat
without
being
ashamed
she
pull
my
hair
young
man
he
declared
with
redoubled
dignity
hearing
the
sniggering
again
but
my
god
if
she
would
but
once

no

my
wish
did
come

felt
for
me

such
is
my
fate

beast

nature

assented
the
innkeeper
yawning
marmeladov
struck
his
fist
resolutely
on
the
table
such
is
my
fate
do

you

young
man
he
went
on
raising
his
head
again
in
your
face
i
seem
to
read
some
trouble
of
mind
when
you
came
in
i
read
it
and
that
wa
why
i
addressed
you
at
once
for
in
unfolding
to
you
the
story
of
my
life
i
do
not
wish
to
make
myself
a
before
these
idle
listener
who
indeed
know
all
about
it
already
but
i
am
looking
for
a
man
of
feeling
and
education
know
then
that
my
wife
wa
educated
in
a
school
for
the
daughter
of
nobleman
and
on
leaving
she
danced
the
shawl
dance
before
the
governor
and
other
personage
for
which
she
wa
presented
with
a
gold
medal
and
a
certificate
of
merit
the
medal
well
the
medal
of
course
wa
sold
long
ago
hm
but
the
certificate
of
merit
is
in
her
trunk
still
and
not
long
ago
she
showed
it
to
our
landlady
and
although
she
is
most
continually
on
bad
term
with
the
landlady
yet
she
wanted
to
tell
someone
or
other
of
her
past
honour
and
of
the
happy
day
that
are
gone
i
don
t
condemn
her
for
it
i
don
t
blame
her
for
the
one
thing
left
her
is
recollection
of
the
past
and
all
the
rest
is
dust
and
ash
yes
yes
she
is
a
lady
of
spirit
proud
and
determined
she
scrub
the
floor
herself
and
ha
nothing
but
black
bread
to
eat
but
won
t
allow
herself
to
be
treated
with
disrespect
that
s
why
she
would
not
overlook
lebeziatnikov
s
rudeness
to
her
and
so
when
he
gave
her
a
beating
for
it
she
took
to
her
bed
more
from
the
hurt
to
her
feeling
than
from
the
blow
she
wa
a
widow
when
i
married
her
with
three
child
one
smaller
than
the
other
she
married
her
first
husband
an
infantry
officer
for
love
and
ran
away
with
him
from
her
father
s
house
she
wa
exceedingly
fond
of
her
husband
but
he
gave
way
to
card
got
into
trouble
and
with
that
he
died
he
used
to
beat
her
at
the
end
and
although
she
paid
him
back
of
which
i
have
authentic
documentary
evidence
to
this
day
she
speaks
of
him
with
tear
and
she
throw
him
up
to
me
and
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
that
though
only
in
imagination
she
should
think
of
herself
a
having
once
been
happy
and
she
wa
left
at
his
death
with
three
child
in
a
wild
and
remote
district
where
i
happened
to
be
at
the
time
and
she
wa
left
in
such
hopeless
poverty
that
although
i
have
seen
many
ups
and
down
of
all
sort
i
don
t
feel
equal
to
describing
it
even
her
relation
had
all
thrown
her
off
and
she
wa
proud
too
excessively
proud
and
then
honoured
sir
and
then
i
being
at
the
time
a
widower
with
a
daughter
of
fourteen
left
me
by
my
first
wife
offered
her
my
hand
for
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
such
suffering
you
can
judge
the
extremity
of
her
calamity
that
she
a
woman
of
education
and
culture
and
distinguished
family
should
have
consented
to
be
my
wife
but
she
did
weeping
and
sobbing
and
wringing
her
hand
she
married
me
for
she
had
nowhere
to
turn
do
you
understand
sir
do
you
understand
what
it
mean
when
you
have
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
no
that
you
don
t
understand
yet
and
for
a
whole
year
i
performed
my
duty
conscientiously
and
faithfully
and
did
not
touch
this
he
tapped
the
jug
with
his
finger
for
i
have
feeling
but
even
so
i
could
not
please
her
and
then
i
lost
my
place
too
and
that
through
no
fault
of
mine
but
through
change
in
the
office
and
then
i
did
touch
it
it
will
be
a
year
and
a
half
ago
soon
since
we
found
ourselves
at
last
after
many
wandering
and
numerous
calamity
in
this
magnificent
capital
adorned
with
innumerable
monument
here
i
obtained
a
situation
i
obtained
it
and
i
lost
it
again
do
you
understand
this
time
it
wa
through
my
own
fault
i
lost
it
for
my
weakness
had
come
out
we
have
now
part
of
a
room
at
amalia
fyodorovna
lippevechsel
s
and
what
we
live
upon
and
what
we
pay
our
rent
with
i
could
not
say
there
are
a
lot
of
people
living
there
besides
ourselves
dirt
and
disorder
a
perfect
bedlam
hm
yes
and
meanwhile
my
daughter
by
my
first
wife
ha
grown
up
and
what
my
daughter
ha
had
to
put
up
with
from
her
whilst
she
wa
growing
up
i
won
t
speak
of
for
though
katerina
ivanovna
is
full
of
generous
feeling
she
is
a
spirited
lady
irritable
and
yes
but
it
s
no
use
going
over
that
sonia
a
you
may
well
fancy
ha
had
no
education
i
did
make
an
effort
four
year
ago
to
give
her
a
course
of
geography
and
universal
history
but
a
i
wa
not
very
well
up
in
those
subject
myself
and
we
had
no
suitable
book
and
what
book
we
had
hm
anyway
we
have
not
even
those
now
so
all
our
instruction
came
to
an
end
we
stopped
at
cyrus
of
persia
since
she
ha
attained
year
of
maturity
she
ha
read
other
book
of
romantic
tendency
and
of
late
she
had
read
with
great
interest
a
book
she
got
through
lebeziatnikov
lewes
physiology
do
you
know
it
and
even
recounted
extract
from
it
to
u
and
that
s
the
whole
of
her
education
and
now
may
i
venture
to
address
you
honoured
sir
on
my
own
account
with
a
private
question
do
you
suppose
that
a
respectable
poor
girl
can
earn
much
by
honest
work
not
fifteen
farthing
a
day
can
she
earn
if
she
is
respectable
and
ha
no
special
talent
and
that
without
putting
her
work
down
for
an
instant
and
what

spoke
but

to
distraction
by
her
illness
and
the
cry
of
the
hungry
child
and
it
wa
said
more
to
wound
her
than
anything
else
for
that

katerina
ivanovna

character
and
when

from

straight
up
to
katerina

and
she
laid
thirty
rouble
on
the
table
before
her
in
silence
she
did
not
utter
a
word

little
shoulder
and
her
body
kept
shuddering
and
i
went
on
lying
there
just
a
before
and
then
i
saw
young
man

the
same
silence
go
up
to

hurriedly
filled
his
glass

and
cleared
his
throat
since
then
sir
he
went
on
after
a
brief
pause
since
then
owing
to
an
unfortunate
occurrence
and
through
information
given
by

all
which
darya

a
leading
part
on
the
pretext

of
respect
since

go
on
living

with
noise

busy
with
the
marmeladov

no
attention
to
the
new
arrival
continued
his
story
he
appeared
by
now
to
be
extremely
weak
but
a
he
became
more
and
more
drunk
he
became
more
and
more
talkative
the
recollection
of
his
recent
success
in
getting
the
situation
seemed
to
revive
him
and
wa
positively
reflected
in
a
sort
of
radiance
on
his
face
raskolnikov

half

first
morning

and
salt

but
she
got
herself
up

a
different
person
she
wa
younger
and
better
looking
sonia
my
little
darling
had
only
helped
with
money
for
the
time
she
said
it
won
t
do
for
me
to

you
hear
i
lay
down
for
a
nap
after

and
what

think
though
katerina
ivanovna
had
quarrelled
to
the
last
degree
with
our
landlady
amalia
fyodorovna
only
a
week
before
she
could
not
resist
then
asking
her
in
to
coffee
for
two
hour
they
were
sitting
whispering
together
semyon
zaharovitch
is

the
service
again
now
and
receiving
a
salary
say
she
and
he
went
himself
to
his
excellency
and
his
excellency
himself
came
out
to
him
made
all
the
others
wait
and
led
semyon
zaharovitch
by
the
hand
before
everybody
into
his
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
to
be
sure
say
he
semyon
zaharovitch
remembering
your
past
service
say
he
and
in
spite
of
your
propensity
to
that
foolish
weakness
since
you
promise
now
and
since
moreover
we
ve
got
on
badly
without
you
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
and
so
say
he
i
rely
now
on
your
word
a
a
and
all
that
let
me
tell
you
she
ha
simply
made
up
for
herself
and
not
simply
out
of
wantonness
for
the
sake
of
bragging
no
she
belief
it
all
herself
she
amuses
herself
with
her
own
fancy
upon
my
word
she
doe
and
i
don
t
blame
her
for
it
no
i
don
t
blame
her
six
day
ago
when
i
brought
her
my
first
earnings
in
full
rouble
forty
copeck
altogether
she
called
me
her
poppet
poppet
said
she
my
little
and
when
we
were
by
ourselves
you
understand
you
would
not
think
me
a
beauty
you
would
not
think
much
of
me
a
a
husband
would
you
well
she
pinched
my
cheek
my
little
poppet
said
marmeladov
broke
off
tried
to
smile
but
suddenly
his
chin
began
to
twitch
he
controlled
himself
however
the
tavern
the
degraded
appearance
of
the
man
the
five
night
in
the
hay
barge
and
the
pot
of
spirit
and
yet
this
poignant
love
for
his
wife
and
child
bewildered
his
listener
raskolnikov
listened
intently
but
with
a
sick
sensation
he
felt
vexed
that
he
had
come
here
honoured
sir
honoured
sir
cried
marmeladov
recovering
himself
oh
sir
perhaps
all
this
seems
a
laughing
matter
to
you
a
it
doe
to
others
and
perhaps
i
am
only
worrying
you
with
the
stupidity
of
all
the
trivial
detail
of
my
home
life
but
it
is
not
a
laughing
matter
to
me
for
i
can
feel
it
all
and
the
whole
of
that
heavenly
day
of
my
life
and
the
whole
of
that
evening
i
passed
in
fleeting
dream
of
how
i
would
arrange
it
all
and
how
i
would
dress
all
the
child
and
how
i
should
give
her
rest
and
how
i
should
rescue
my
own
daughter
from
dishonour
and
restore
her
to
the
bosom
of
her
family
and
a
great
deal
more
quite
excusable
sir
well
then
sir
marmeladov
suddenly
gave
a
sort
of
start
raised
his
head
and
gazed
intently
at
his
listener
well
on
the
very
next
day
after
all
those
dream
that
is
to
say
exactly
five
day
ago
in
the
evening
by
a
cunning
trick
like
a
thief
in
the
night
i
stole
from
katerina
ivanovna
the
key
of
her
box
took
out
what
wa
left
of
my
earnings
how
much
it
wa
i
have
forgotten
and
now
look
at
me
all
of
you
it
s
the
fifth
day
since
i
left
home
and
they
are
looking
for
me
there
and
it
s
the
end
of
my
employment
and
my
uniform
is
lying
in
a
tavern
on
the
egyptian
bridge
i
exchanged
it
for
the
garment
i
have
on
and
it
s
the
end
of
everything
marmeladov
struck
his
forehead
with
his
fist
clenched
his
teeth
closed
his
eye
and
leaned
heavily
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
but
a
minute
later
his
face
suddenly
changed
and
with
a
certain
assumed
slyness
and
affectation
of
bravado
he
glanced
at
raskolnikov
laughed
and
said
this
morning
i
went
to
see
sonia
i
went
to
ask
her
for
a
you
don
t
say
she
gave
it
to
you
cried
one
of
the
he
shouted
the
word
and
went
off
into
a
guffaw
this
very
quart
wa
bought
with
her
money
marmeladov
declared
addressing
himself
exclusively
to
raskolnikov
thirty
copeck

gave
me
with
her
own
hand
her
last
all
she
had
a
i
saw
she
said
nothing
she
only
looked
at
me
without
a
word
not
on
earth
but
up
yonder
they
grieve
over
men
they
weep
but
they
don
t
blame
them
they
don
t
blame
them
but
it
hurt
more
it
hurt
more
when
they
don
t
blame
thirty
copeck

maybe

over
a
puddle

copeck
of

and

pot
wa
empty

for
shouted
the
who
wa
again
near
them
shout
of
laughter
and
even
oath
followed
the
laughter
and
the
oath
came
from
those
who
were
listening
and
also
from
those
who
had
heard
nothing
but
were
simply
looking
at
the
figure
of
the
discharged
government
clerk
to
be
pitied
why
am
i
to
be
pitied
marmeladov
suddenly
declaimed
standing
up
with
his
arm
outstretched
a
though
he
had
been
only
waiting
for
that
question
why
am
i
to
be
pitied
you
say
yes

tasted

consumptive
and
for
the
little
child
of

where

evil
the

before

and
he
will
say
unto
u

image
of

beast
and

his
mark
but

and
the

and
those

katerina
ivanovna
even
she
will
understand
lord
thy
kingdom
come
and
he
sank
down
on
the
bench
exhausted
and
helpless
looking
at
no
one
apparently
oblivious
of
his
surroundings
and
plunged
in
deep
thought
his
word
had
created
a
certain
impression
there
wa
a
moment
of
silence
but
soon
laughter
and
oath
were
heard
again
that
s
his
notion
talked
himself
silly
a
fine
clerk
he
is
and
so
on
and
so
on
let
u
go
sir
said
marmeladov
all
at
once
raising
his
head
and
addressing
raskolnikov
come
along
with
me
kozel

house
looking
into
the
yard
i
m
going
to
katerina
ivanovna
time
i
raskolnikov
had
for
some
time
been
wanting
to
go
and
he
had
meant
to
help
him
marmeladov
wa
much
unsteadier
on
his
leg
than
in
his
speech
and
leaned
heavily
on
the
young
man
they
had
two
or
three
hundred
pace
to
go
the
drunken
man
wa
more
and
more
overcome
by
dismay
and
confusion
a
they
drew
nearer
the
house
it
s
not
katerina
ivanovna
i
am
afraid
of
now
he
muttered
in
agitation
and
that
she
will
begin
pulling
my
hair
what
doe
my
hair
matter
bother
my
hair
that
s
what
i
say

will
be
better
if

doe
begin
pulling
it
that
s
not
what
i
am
afraid
of

am
afraid
of

her
eye

red
on
her
cheek

frightens
me
and
her
breathing
too

you
noticed
how
people
in
that
disease
breathe
when
they
are
excited
i
am
frightened

smoldering

appeared
that
the
family

a
room

themselves
not

their
room

tall
slim
and
graceful
woman
terribly
emaciated
with
magnificent
dark
brown
hair
and
with
a
hectic
flush
in
her
cheek

pacing

and
down
in

little
room

her
hand
against
her
chest
her
lip

parched
and
her
breathing
came
in
nervous
broken
gasp
her
eye
glittered
a
in
fever
and
looked
about
with
a
harsh
immovable
stare
and
that
consumptive
and
excited
face
with
the
last
flickering
light
of
the
playing
upon
it
made
a
sickening
impression
she
seemed
to
raskolnikov
about
thirty
year
old
and
wa
certainly
a
strange
wife
for
marmeladov
she
had
not
heard

and
did
not

seemed
to

she
had

of
six

asleep
sitting
curled
up
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
the
sofa
a
boy
a
year
older
stood
cry
and
shaking
in
the
corner
probably
he
had
just
had
a
beating
beside
him
stood
a
girl
of
nine
year
old
tall
and
thin
wearing
a
thin
and
ragged
chemise
with
an
ancient
cashmere
pelisse
flung
over
her
bare
shoulder
long
outgrown
and
barely
reaching
her
knee
her
arm
a
thin
a
a
stick
wa
round
her
brother
s
neck
she
wa
trying
to
comfort
him
whispering
something
to
him
and
doing
all
she
could
to
keep
him
from
whimpering
again
at
the
same
time
her
large
dark
eye
which
looked
larger
still
from
the
thinness
of
her
frightened
face
were
watching
her
mother
with
alarm
marmeladov
did
not
enter
the
door
but
dropped
on
his
knee
in
the
very
doorway
pushing
raskolnikov
in
front
of
him
the
woman
seeing
a
stranger
stopped
indifferently
facing
him
coming
to
herself
for
a
moment
and
apparently
wondering
what
he
had
come
for
but
evidently
she
decided
that
he
wa
going
into
the
next
room
a
he
had
to
pas
through
hers
to
get
there
taking
no
further
notice
of
him
she
walked
towards
the
outer
door
to
close
it
and
uttered
a
sudden
scream
on
seeing
her
husband
on
his
knee
in
the
doorway
ah
she
cried
out
in
a
frenzy
he
ha
come
back
the
criminal
the
monster
and
where
is
the
money
what
s
in
your
pocket
show
me
and
your
clothes
are
all
different
where
are
your
clothes
where
is
the
money
speak
and
she
fell
to
searching
him
marmeladov
submissively
and
obediently
held
up
both
arm
to
facilitate
the
search
not
a
farthing
wa
there
where
is
the
money
she
cried
mercy
on
u

have
drunk
it
all
there
were
twelve
silver
rouble
left
in
the
chest
and
in
a
fury
she
seized
him
by
the
hair
and
dragged
him
into
the
room
marmeladov
seconded
her
effort
by
meekly
crawling
along
on
his
knee
and
this
is
a
consolation
to
me
this
doe
not
hurt
me
but
is
a
positive
sir
he
called
out
shaken
to
and
fro
by
his
hair
and
even
once
striking
the
ground
with
his
forehead
the
child
asleep
on
the
floor
woke
up
and
began
to
cry
the
boy
in
the
corner
losing
all
control
began
trembling
and
screaming
and
rushed
to
his
sister
in
violent
terror
almost
in
a
fit
the
eldest
girl
wa
shaking
like
a
leaf
he
s
drunk
it
he
s
drunk
it
all
the
poor
woman
screamed
in
despair
and
his
clothes
are
gone
and
they
are
hungry
hungry
and
wringing
her
hand
she
pointed
to
the
child
oh
accursed
life
and
you
are
you
not
ashamed
she
pounced
all
at

upon
raskolnikov
from
the
tavern

drinking
with
him
you
have

go
away
the
young
man
wa
hastening
away
without
uttering
a
word
the
inner
door
wa
thrown
wide
open
and
inquisitive
face
were
peering
in
at
it
coarse
laughing
face
with
pipe
and
cigarette
and
head
wearing
cap
thrust
themselves
in
at
the
doorway
further
in
could
be
seen
figure
in
dressing
gown
flung
open
in
costume
of
unseemly
scantiness
some
of
them
with
card
in
their
hand
they
were
particularly
diverted
when
marmeladov
dragged
about
by
his
hair
shouted
that
it
wa
a
consolation
to
him
they
even
began
to
come
into
the
room
at
last
a
sinister
shrill
outcry
wa
heard
this
came
from
amalia
lippevechsel
herself
pushing
her
way
amongst
them
and
trying
to
restore
order
after
her
own
fashion
and
for
the
hundredth
time
to
frighten
the
poor
woman
by
ordering
her
with
coarse
abuse
to
clear
out
of
the
room
next
day
a
he
went
out
raskolnikov
had
time
to
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
snatch
up
the
copper
he
had
received
in
exchange
for
his
rouble
in
the
tavern
and
to
lay
them
unnoticed
on
the
window
afterwards
on
the
stair
he
changed
his
mind
and
would
have
gone
back
what
a
stupid
thing
i
ve
done
he
thought
to
himself
they
have
sonia
and
i
want
it
but
reflecting
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
it
back
now
and
that
in
any
case
he
would
not
have
taken
it
he
dismissed
it
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
went
back
to
his
lodging
sonia
want
pomatum
too
he
said
a
he
walked
along
the
street
and
he
laughed
malignantly
such
smartness
cost
money
hm
and
maybe
sonia
herself
will
be
bankrupt
for
there
is
always
a
risk
hunting
big
game
digging
for
gold
then
they
would
all
be
without
a
crust
except
for
my
money
hurrah
for
sonia
what
a
mine
they
ve
dug
there
and
they
re
making
the
most
of
it
yes
they
are
making
the
most
of
it
they
ve
wept
over
it
and
grown
used
to
it
man
grows
used
to
everything
the
scoundrel
he
sank
into
thought
and
what
if
i
am
wrong
he
cried
suddenly
after
a
moment
s
thought
what
if
man
is
not
really
a
scoundrel
man
in
general
i
mean
the
whole
race
of
mankind
then
all
the
rest
is
prejudice
simply
artificial
terror
and
there
are
no
barrier

it

he
waked
up
late
next
day
after
a
broken
sleep
but
his
sleep
had
not
refreshed
him
he
waked
up
bilious
irritable
and
looked
with
hatred
at
his
room
it
wa
a
tiny
cupboard
of
a
room
about
six
pace
in
length
it
had
a
appearance
with
it
dusty
yellow
paper
peeling
off
the
wall
and
it
wa
so
that
a
man
of
more
than
average
height
wa
ill
at
ease
in
it
and
felt
every
moment
that
he
would
knock
his
head
against
the
ceiling
the
furniture
wa
in
keeping
with
the
room
there
were
three
old
chair
rather
rickety
a
painted
table
in
the
corner
on
which
lay
a
few
manuscript
and
book
the
dust
that
lay
thick
upon
them
showed
that
they
had
been
long
untouched
a
big
clumsy
sofa
occupied
almost
the
whole
of
one
wall
and
half
the
floor
space
of
the
room
it
wa
once
covered
with
chintz
but
wa
now
in

he
went
to
sleep
on
it
a
he
wa
without
undressing
without
sheet
wrapped
in
his
old
student
s
overcoat
with
his
head
on
one
little
pillow
under
which
he
heaped
up
all
the
linen
he
had
clean
and
dirty
by
way
of
a
bolster
a
little
table
stood
in
front
of
the
sofa
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
sink
to
a
lower
ebb
of
disorder
but
to
raskolnikov
in
his
present
state
of
mind
this
wa
positively
agreeable
he
had
got
completely
away
from
everyone
like
a
tortoise
in
it
shell
and
even
the
sight
of
a
servant
girl
who
had
to
wait
upon
him
and
looked
sometimes
into
his
room
made
him
writhe
with
nervous
irritation
he
wa
in
the
condition
that
overtakes
some
monomaniac
entirely
concentrated
upon
one
thing
his
landlady
had
for
the
last
fortnight
given
up
sending
him
in
meal
and
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
expostulating
with
her
though
he
went
without
his
dinner
nastasya
the
cook
and
only
servant
wa
rather
pleased
at
the
lodger
s
mood
and
had
entirely
given
up
sweeping
and
doing
his
room
only
once
a
week
or
so
she
would
stray
into
his
room
with
a
broom
she
waked
him
up
that
day
get
up
why
are

asleep
she
called
to

raskolnikov
opened
his
eye
started
and
recognised
nastasya
from
the
landlady
eh
he
asked
slowly
and
with
a
sickly
face
sitting
up
on
the
sofa
from
the
landlady
indeed
she
set
before
him
her
own
cracked
teapot
full
of
weak
and
stale
tea
and
laid
two
yellow
lump
of
sugar
by
the
side
of
it
here
nastasya

it
please
he
said
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
and
taking
out
a
handful
of
copper
run
and
buy
me
a
loaf
and

a
little
sausage

capital
soup

it
for

but
you

in

fine
when
the
soup
had
been
brought
and
he
had
begun
upon
it
nastasya
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
began
chatting
she
wa
a
country
and
a
very
talkative
one
praskovya
pavlovna
mean
to
complain
to
the
police
about

she
said
he
scowled
to
the
police
what
doe
she
want
you
don
t
pay
her
money
and
you
won

what
she
want
to
be

devil
that

he
muttered
grinding
his
teeth
no
that
would
not
suit
me
just
now
she
is
a
fool
he
added
aloud
i
ll
go
and
talk
to
her
fool
she
is
and
no
mistake
just
a
i
am
but
why
if
you
are
so
clever
do
you
lie
here
like
a
sack
and
have
nothing
to
show
for
it
one
time
you
used
to
go
out
you
say
to
teach
child
but
why
is
it
you
do
nothing
now
i
am
doing
raskolnikov
began
sullenly
and
reluctantly
what
are
you
doing
work
what
sort
of
work
i
am
thinking
he
answered
seriously
after
a
pause
nastasya
wa
overcome
with
a
fit
of
laughter
she
wa
given
to
laughter
and
when
anything
amused
her
she
laughed
inaudibly
quivering
and
shaking
all
over
till
she
felt
and
have
you
made
much
money
by
your
thinking
she
managed
to
articulate
at
last
one
can
t
go
out
to
give
lesson
without
boot
and
i
m
sick
of
don
t
quarrel
with
your
bread
and
they
pay
so
little
for
lesson
what
s
the
use
of
a
few
copper
he
answered
reluctantly
a
though
replying
to
his
own
thought
and
you
want
to
get
a
fortune
all
at
once
he
looked
at
her
strangely
yes
i
want
a
fortune
he
answered
firmly
after
a
brief
pause
don
t
be
in
such
a
hurry
you
quite
frighten
me
shall
i
get
you
the
loaf
or
not
a
you
ah
i
forgot
a
letter
came
for
you
yesterday
when
you
were
a
letter
for
me
from
whom
i
can
t
say
i
gave
three
copeck
of
my
own
to
the
postman
for
it
will
you
pay
me
back
then

it
to
me
for
god
s
sake

cried
raskolnikov
greatly
excited
good
god
a
minute
later
the
letter
wa
brought
him
that
wa
it
from
his
mother
from
the
province
of
r
he
turned
pale
when
he
took
it
it
wa
a
long
while
since
he
had
received
a
letter
but
another
feeling
also
suddenly
stabbed
his
heart
nastasya
leave
me
alone
for
goodness
sake
here
are
your
three
copeck
but
for
goodness
sake
make
haste
and
go
the
letter
wa
quivering
in
his
hand
he
did
not
want
to
open
it
in
her
presence
he
wanted
to
be
left
with
this
letter
when
nastasya
had
gone
out
he
lifted
it
quickly
to
his
lip
and
kissed
it
then
he
gazed
intently
at
the
address
the
small
sloping
handwriting
so
dear
and
familiar
of
the
mother
who
had
once
taught
him
to
read
and
write
he
delayed
he
seemed
almost
afraid
of
something
at
last
he
opened
it
it
wa
a
thick
heavy
letter
weighing
over
two
ounce
two
large
sheet
of
note
paper
were
covered
with
very
small
handwriting
my
dear
rodya
wrote
his
mother
it
s
two
month
since
i
last
had
a
talk
with
you
by
letter
which
ha
distressed
me
and
even
kept
me
awake
at
night
thinking
but
i
am
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
for
my
inevitable
silence
you
know
how
i
love
you
you
are
all
we
have
to
look
to
dounia
and
i
you
are
our
all
our
one
hope
our
one
stay
what
a
grief
it
wa
to
me
when
i
heard
that
you
had
given
up
the
university
some
month
ago
for
want
of
mean
to
keep
yourself
and
that
you
had
lost
your
lesson
and
your
other
work
how
could
i
help
you
out
of
my
hundred
and
twenty
rouble
a
year
pension
the
fifteen
rouble
i
sent
you
four
month
ago
i
borrowed
a
you
know
on
security
of
my
pension
from
vassily
ivanovitch
vahrushin
a
merchant
of
this
town
he
is
a
man
and
wa
a
friend
of
your
father
s
too
but
having
given
him
the
right
to
receive
the
pension
i
had
to
wait
till
the
debt
wa
paid
off
and
that
is
only
just
done
so
that
i
ve
been
unable
to
send
you
anything
all
this
time
but
now
thank
god
i
believe
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
something
more
and
in
fact
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
good
fortune
now
of
which
i
hasten
to
inform
you
in
the
first
place
would
you
have
guessed
dear
rodya
that
your
sister
ha
been
living
with
me
for
the
last
six
week
and
we
shall
not
be
separated
in
the
future
thank
god
her
suffering
are
over
but
i
will
tell
you
everything
in
order
so
that
you
may
know
just
how
everything
ha
happened
and
all
that
we
have
hitherto
concealed
from
you
when
you
wrote
to
me
two
month
ago
that
you
had
heard
that
dounia
had
a
great
deal
to
put
up
with
in
the
svidrigaïlovs
house
when
you
wrote
that
and
asked
me
to
tell
you
all
about
it
what
could
i
write
in
answer
to
you
if
i
had
written
the
whole
truth
to
you
i
dare
say
you
would
have
thrown
up
everything
and
have
come
to
u
even
if
you
had
to
walk
all
the
way
for
i
know
your
character
and
your
feeling
and
you
would
not
let
your
sister
be
insulted
i
wa
in
despair
myself
but
what
could
i
do
and
besides
i
did
not
know
the
whole
truth
myself
then
what
made
it
all
so
difficult
wa
that
dounia
received
a
hundred
rouble
in
advance
when
she
took
the
place
a
governess
in
their
family
on
condition
of
part
of
her
salary
being
deducted
every
month
and
so
it
wa
impossible
to
throw
up
the
situation
without
repaying
the
debt
this
sum
now
i
can
explain
it
all
to
you
my
precious
rodya
she
took
chiefly
in
order
to
send
you
sixty
rouble
which
you
needed
so
terribly
then
and
which
you
received
from
u
last
year
we
deceived
you
then
writing
that
this
money
came
from
dounia
s
saving
but
that
wa
not
so
and
now
i
tell
you
all
about
it
because
thank
god
thing
have
suddenly
changed
for
the
better
and
that
you
may
know
how
dounia
love
you
and
what
a
heart
she
ha
at
first
indeed
svidrigaïlov
treated
her
very
rudely
and
used
to
make
disrespectful
and
jeering
remark
at
table
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
into
all
those
painful
detail
so
a
not
to
worry
you
for
nothing
when
it
is
now
all
over
in
short
in
spite
of
the
kind
and
generous
behaviour
of
marfa
petrovna
svidrigaïlov
s
wife
and
all
the
rest
of
the
household
dounia
had
a
very
hard
time
especially
when
svidrigaïlov
relapsing
into
his
old
regimental
habit
wa
under
the
influence
of
bacchus
and
how
do
you
think
it
wa
all
explained
later
on
would
you
believe
that
the
crazy
fellow
had
conceived
a
passion
for
dounia
from
the
beginning
but
had
concealed
it
under
a
show
of
rudeness
and
contempt
possibly
he
wa
ashamed
and
horrified
himself
at
his
own
flighty
hope
considering
his
year
and
his
being
the
father
of
a
family
and
that
made
him
angry
with
dounia
and
possibly
too
he
hoped
by
his
rude
and
sneering
behaviour
to
hide
the
truth
from
others
but
at
last
he
lost
all
control
and
had
the
face
to
make
dounia
an
open
and
shameful
proposal
promising
her
all
sort
of
inducement
and
offering
besides
to
throw
up
everything
and
take
her
to
another
estate
of
his
or
even
abroad
you
can
imagine
all
she
went
through
to
leave
her
situation
at
once
wa
impossible
not
only
on
account
of
the
money
debt
but
also
to
spare
the
feeling
of
marfa
petrovna
whose
suspicion
would
have
been
aroused
and
then
dounia
would
have
been
the
cause
of
a
rupture
in
the
family
and
it
would
have
meant
a
terrible
scandal
for
dounia
too
that
would
have
been
inevitable
there
were
various
other
reason
owing
to
which
dounia
could
not
hope
to
escape
from
that
awful
house
for
another
six
week
you
know
dounia
of
course
you
know
how
clever
she
is
and
what
a
strong
will
she
ha
dounia
can
endure
a
great
deal
and
even
in
the
most
difficult
case
she
ha
the
fortitude
to
maintain
her
firmness
she
did
not
even
write
to
me
about
everything
for
fear
of
upsetting
me
although
we
were
constantly
in
communication
it
all
ended
very
unexpectedly
marfa
petrovna
accidentally
overheard
her
husband
imploring
dounia
in
the
garden
and
putting
quite
a
wrong
interpretation
on
the
position
threw
the
blame
upon
her
believing
her
to
be
the
cause
of
it
all
an
awful
scene
took
place
between
them
on
the
spot
in
the
garden
marfa
petrovna
went
so
far
a
to
strike
dounia
refused
to
hear
anything
and
wa
shouting
at
her
for
a
whole
hour
and
then
gave
order
that
dounia
should
be
packed
off
at
once
to
me
in
a
plain
peasant
s
cart
into
which
they
flung
all
her
thing
her
linen
and
her
clothes
all
without
folding
it
up
and
packing
it
and
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
came
on
too
and
dounia
insulted
and
put
to
shame
had
to
drive
with
a
peasant
in
an
open
cart
all
the
seventeen
verst
into
town
only
think
now
what
answer
could
i
have
sent
to
the
letter
i
received
from
you
two
month
ago
and
what
could
i
have
written
i
wa
in
despair
i
dared
not
write
to
you
the
truth
because
you
would
have
been
very
unhappy
mortified
and
indignant
and
yet
what
could
you
do
you
could
only
perhaps
ruin
yourself
and
besides
dounia
would
not
allow
it
and
fill
up
my
letter
with
trifle
when
my
heart
wa
so
full
of
sorrow
i
could
not
for
a
whole
month
the
town
wa
full
of
gossip
about
this
scandal
and
it
came
to
such
a
pas
that
dounia
and
i
dared
not
even
go
to
church
on
account
of
the
contemptuous
look
whisper
and
even
remark
made
aloud
about
u
all
our
acquaintance
avoided
u
nobody
even
bowed
to
u
in
the
street
and
i
learnt
that
some
shopmen
and
clerk
were
intending
to
insult
u
in
a
shameful
way
smearing
the
gate
of
our
house
with
pitch
so
that
the
landlord
began
to
tell
u
we
must
leave
all
this
wa
set
going
by
marfa
petrovna
who
managed
to
slander
dounia
and
throw
dirt
at
her
in
every
family
she
know
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
and
that
month
she
wa
continually
coming
into
the
town
and
a
she
is
rather
talkative
and
fond
of
gossiping
about
her
family
affair
and
particularly
of
complaining
to
all
and
each
of
her
husband
which
is
not
at
all
right
so
in
a
short
time
she
had
spread
her
story
not
only
in
the
town
but
over
the
whole
surrounding
district
it
made
me
ill
but
dounia
bore
it
better
than
i
did
and
if
only
you
could
have
seen
how
she
endured
it
all
and
tried
to
comfort
me
and
cheer
me
up
she
is
an
angel
but
by
god
s
mercy
our
suffering
were
cut
short
svidrigaïlov
returned
to
his
sens
and
repented
and
probably
feeling
sorry
for
dounia
he
laid
before
marfa
petrovna
a
complete
and
unmistakable
proof
of
dounia
s
innocence
in
the
form
of
a
letter
dounia
had
been
forced
to
write
and
give
to
him
before
marfa
petrovna
came
upon
them
in
the
garden
this
letter
which
remained
in
svidrigaïlov
s
hand
after
her
departure
she
had
written
to
refuse
personal
explanation
and
secret
interview
for
which
he
wa
entreating
her
in
that
letter
she
reproached
him
with
great
heat
and
indignation
for
the
baseness
of
his
behaviour
in
regard
to
marfa
petrovna
reminding
him
that
he
wa
the
father
and
head
of
a
family
and
telling
him
how
infamous
it
wa
of
him
to
torment
and
make
unhappy
a
defenceless
girl
unhappy
enough
already
indeed
dear
rodya
the
letter
wa
so
nobly
and
touchingly
written
that
i
sobbed
when
i
read
it
and
to
this
day
i
can
not
read
it
without
tear
moreover
the
evidence
of
the
servant
too
cleared
dounia
s
reputation
they
had
seen
and
known
a
great
deal
more
than
svidrigaïlov
had
himself
supposed
a
indeed
is
always
the
case
with
servant
marfa
petrovna
wa
completely
taken
aback
and
again
crushed
a
she
said
herself
to
u
but
she
wa
completely
convinced
of
dounia
s
innocence
the
very
next
day
being
sunday
she
went
straight
to
the
cathedral
knelt
down
and
prayed
with
tear
to
our
lady
to
give
her
strength
to
bear
this
new
trial
and
to
do
her
duty
then
she
came
straight
from
the
cathedral
to
u
told
u
the
whole
story
wept
bitterly
and
fully
penitent
she
embraced
dounia
and
besought
her
to
forgive
her
the
same
morning
without
any
delay
she
went
round
to
all
the
house
in
the
town
and
everywhere
shedding
tear
she
asserted
in
the
most
flattering
term
dounia
s
innocence
and
the
nobility
of
her
feeling
and
her
behavior
what
wa
more
she
showed
and
read
to
everyone
the
letter
in
dounia
s
own
handwriting
to
svidrigaïlov
and
even
allowed
them
to
take
copy
of
it
which
i
must
say
i
think
wa
superfluous
in
this
way
she
wa
busy
for
several
day
in
driving
about
the
whole
town
because
some
people
had
taken
offence
through
precedence
having
been
given
to
others
and
therefore
they
had
to
take
turn
so
that
in
every
house
she
wa
expected
before
she
arrived
and
everyone
knew
that
on
such
and
such
a
day
marfa
petrovna
would
be
reading
the
letter
in
such
and
such
a
place
and
people
assembled
for
every
reading
of
it
even
many
who
had
heard
it
several
time
already
both
in
their
own
house
and
in
other
people
s
in
my
opinion
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
all
this
wa
unnecessary
but
that
s
marfa
petrovna
s
character
anyway
she
succeeded
in
completely
dounia
s
reputation
and
the
whole
ignominy
of
this
affair
rested
a
an
indelible
disgrace
upon
her
husband
a
the
only
person
to
blame
so
that
i
really
began
to
feel
sorry
for
him
it
wa
really
treating
the
crazy
fellow
too
harshly
dounia
wa
at
once
asked
to
give
lesson
in
several
family
but
she
refused
all
of
a
sudden
everyone
began
to
treat
her
with
marked
respect
and
all
this
did
much
to
bring
about
the
event
by
which
one
may
say
our
whole
fortune
are
now
transformed
you
must
know
dear
rodya
that
dounia
ha
a
suitor
and
that
she
ha
already
consented
to
marry
him
i
hasten
to
tell
you
all
about
the
matter
and
though
it
ha
been
arranged
without
asking
your
consent
i
think
you
will
not
be
aggrieved
with
me
or
with
your
sister
on
that
account
for
you
will
see
that
we
could
not
wait
and
put
off
our
decision
till
we
heard
from
you
and
you
could
not
have
judged
all
the
fact
without
being
on
the
spot
this
wa
how
it
happened
he
is
already
of
the
rank
of
a
counsellor
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
and
is
distantly
related
to
marfa
petrovna
who
ha
been
very
active
in
bringing
the
match
about
it
began
with
his
expressing
through
her
his
desire
to
make
our
acquaintance
he
wa
properly
received
drank
coffee
with
u
and
the
very
next
day
he
sent
u
a
letter
in
which
he
very
courteously
made
an
offer
and
begged
for
a
speedy
and
decided
answer
he
is
a
very
busy
man
and
is
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
to
petersburg
so
that
every
moment
is
precious
to
him
at
first
of
course
we
were
greatly
surprised
a
it
had
all
happened
so
quickly
and
unexpectedly
we
thought
and
talked
it
over
the
whole
day
he
is
a
man
to
be
depended
upon
he
ha
two
post
in
the
government
and
ha
already
made
his
fortune
it
is
true
that
he
is
year
old
but
he
is
of
a
fairly
prepossessing
appearance
and
might
still
be
thought
attractive
by
woman
and
he
is
altogether
a
very
respectable
and
presentable
man
only
he
seems
a
little
morose
and
somewhat
conceited
but
possibly
that
may
only
be
the
impression
he
make
at
first
sight
and
beware
dear
rodya
when
he
come
to
petersburg
a
he
shortly
will
do
beware
of
judging
him
too
hastily
and
severely
a
your
way
is
if
there
is
anything
you
do
not
like
in
him
at
first
sight
i
give
you
this
warning
although
i
feel
sure
that
he
will
make
a
favourable
impression
upon
you
moreover
in
order
to
understand
any
man
one
must
be
deliberate
and
careful
to
avoid
forming
prejudice
and
mistaken
idea
which
are
very
difficult
to
correct
and
get
over
afterwards
and
pyotr
petrovitch
judging
by
many
indication
is
a
thoroughly
estimable
man
at
his
first
visit
indeed
he
told
u
that
he
wa
a
practical
man
but
still
he
share
a
he
expressed
it
many
of
the
conviction
of
our
most
rising
generation
and
he
is
an
opponent
of
all
prejudice
he
said
a
good
deal
more
for
he
seems
a
little
conceited
and
like
to
be
listened
to
but
this
is
scarcely
a
vice
i
of
course
understood
very
little
of
it
but
dounia
explained
to
me
that
though
he
is
not
a
man
of
great
education
he
is
clever
and
seems
to
be
you
know
your
sister
s
character
rodya
she
is
a
resolute
sensible
patient
and
generous
girl
but
she
ha
a
passionate
heart
a
i
know
very
well
of
course
there
is
no
great
love
either
on
his
side
or
on
hers
but
dounia
is
a
clever
girl
and
ha
the
heart
of
an
angel
and
will
make
it
her
duty
to
make
her
husband
happy
who
on
his
side
will
make
her
happiness
his
care
of
that
we
have
no
good
reason
to
doubt
though
it
must
be
admitted
the
matter
ha
been
arranged
in
great
haste
besides
he
is
a
man
of
great
prudence
and
he
will
see
to
be
sure
of
himself
that
his
own
happiness
will
be
the
more
secure
the
happier
dounia
is
with
him
and
a
for
some
defect
of
character
for
some
habit
and
even
certain
difference
of
opinion
which
indeed
are
inevitable
even
in
the
happiest
marriage
dounia
ha
said
that
a
regard
all
that
she
relies
on
herself
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
and
that
she
is
ready
to
put
up
with
a
great
deal
if
only
their
future
relationship
can
be
an
honourable
and
straightforward
one
he
struck
me
for
instance
at
first
a
rather
abrupt
but
that
may
well
come
from
his
being
an
outspoken
man
and
that
is
no
doubt
how
it
is
for
instance
at
his
second
visit
after
he
had
received
dounia
s
consent
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
declared
that
before
making
dounia
s
acquaintance
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
a
girl
of
good
reputation
without
dowry
and
above
all
one
who
had
experienced
poverty
because
a
he
explained
a
man
ought
not
to
be
indebted
to
his
wife
but
that
it
is
better
for
a
wife
to
look
upon
her
husband
a
her
benefactor
i
must
add
that
he
expressed
it
more
nicely
and
politely
than
i
have
done
for
i
have
forgotten
his
actual
phrase
and
only
remember
the
meaning
and
besides
it
wa
obviously
not
said
of
design
but
slipped
out
in
the
heat
of
conversation
so
that
he
tried
afterwards
to
correct
himself
and
smooth
it
over
but
all
the
same
it
did
strike
me
a
somewhat
rude
and
i
said
so
afterwards
to
dounia
but
dounia
wa
vexed
and
answered
that
word
are
not
deed
and
that
of
course
is
perfectly
true
dounia
did
not
sleep
all
night
before
she
made
up
her
mind
and
thinking
that
i
wa
asleep
she
got
out
of
bed
and
wa
walking
up
and
down
the
room
all
night
at
last
she
knelt
down
before
the
ikon
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
and
in
the
morning
she
told
me
that
she
had
decided
i
have
mentioned
already
that
pyotr
petrovitch
is
just
setting
off
for
petersburg
where
he
ha
a
great
deal
of
business
and
he
want
to
open
a
legal
bureau
he
ha
been
occupied
for
many
year
in
conducting
civil
and
commercial
litigation
and
only
the
other
day
he
won
an
important
case
he
ha
to
be
in
petersburg
because
he
ha
an
important
case
before
the
senate
so
rodya
dear
he
may
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
you
in
every
way
indeed
and
dounia
and
i
have
agreed
that
from
this
very
day
you
could
definitely
enter
upon
your
career
and
might
consider
that
your
future
is
marked
out
and
assured
for
you
oh
if
only
this
come
to
pas
this
would
be
such
a
benefit
that
we
could
only
look
upon
it
a
a
providential
blessing
dounia
is
dreaming
of
nothing
else
we
have
even
ventured
already
to
drop
a
few
word
on
the
subject
to
pyotr
petrovitch
he
wa
cautious
in
his
answer
and
said
that
of
course
a
he
could
not
get
on
without
a
secretary
it
would
be
better
to
be
paying
a
salary
to
a
relation
than
to
a
stranger
if
only
the
former
were
fitted
for
the
duty
a
though
there
could
be
doubt
of
your
being
fitted
but
then
he
expressed
doubt
whether
your
study
at
the
university
would
leave
you
time
for
work
at
his
office
the
matter
dropped
for
the
time
but
dounia
is
thinking
of
nothing
else
now
she
ha
been
in
a
sort
of
fever
for
the
last
few
day
and
ha
already
made
a
regular
plan
for
your
becoming
in
the
end
an
associate
and
even
a
partner
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
business
which
might
well
be
seeing
that
you
are
a
student
of
law
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
her
rodya
and
share
all
her
plan
and
hope
and
think
there
is
every
probability
of
realising
them
and
in
spite
of
pyotr
petrovitch
s
evasiveness
very
natural
at
present
since
he
doe
not
know
you
dounia
is
firmly
persuaded
that
she
will
gain
everything
by
her
good
influence
over
her
future
husband
this
she
is
reckoning
upon
of
course
we
are
careful
not
to
talk
of
any
of
these
more
remote
plan
to
pyotr
petrovitch
especially
of
your
becoming
his
partner
he
is
a
practical
man
and
might
take
this
very
coldly
it
might
all
seem
to
him
simply
a
nor
ha
either
dounia
or
i
breathed
a
word
to
him
of
the
great
hope
we
have
of
his
helping
u
to
pay
for
your
university
study
we
have
not
spoken
of
it
in
the
first
place
because
it
will
come
to
pas
of
itself
later
on
and
he
will
no
doubt
without
wasting
word
offer
to
do
it
of
himself
a
though
he
could
refuse
dounia
that
the
more
readily
since
you
may
by
your
own
effort
become
his
right
hand
in
the
office
and
receive
this
assistance
not
a
a
charity
but
a
a
salary
earned
by
your
own
work
dounia
want
to
arrange
it
all
like
this
and
i
quite
agree
with
her
and
we
have
not
spoken
of
our
plan
for
another
reason
that
is
because
i
particularly
wanted
you
to
feel
on
an
equal
footing
when
you
first
meet
him
when
dounia
spoke
to
him
with
enthusiasm
about
you
he
answered
that
one
could
never
judge
of
a
man
without
seeing
him
close
for
oneself
and
that
he
looked
forward
to
forming
his
own
opinion
when
he
make
your
acquaintance
do
you
know
my
precious
rodya
i
think
that
perhaps
for
some
reason
nothing
to
do
with
pyotr
petrovitch
though
simply
for
my
own
personal
perhaps
fancy
i
should
do
better
to
go
on
living
by
myself
apart
than
with
them
after
the
wedding
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
be
generous
and
delicate
enough
to
invite
me
and
to
urge
me
to
remain
with
my
daughter
for
the
future
and
if
he
ha
said
nothing
about
it
hitherto
it
is
simply
because
it
ha
been
taken
for
granted
but
i
shall
refuse
i
have
noticed
more
than
once
in
my
life
that
husband
don
t
quite
get
on
with
their
and
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
least
bit
in
anyone
s
way
and
for
my
own
sake
too
would
rather
be
quite
independent
so
long
a
i
have
a
crust
of
bread
of
my
own
and
such
child
a
you
and
dounia
if
possible
i
would
settle
somewhere
near
you
for
the
most
joyful
piece
of
news
dear
rodya
i
have
kept
for
the
end
of
my
letter
know
then
my
dear
boy
that
we
may
perhaps
be
all
together
in
a
very
short
time
and
may
embrace
one
another
again
after
a
separation
of
almost
three
year
it
is
settled
that
dounia
and
i
are
to
set
off
for
petersburg
exactly
when
i
don
t
know
but
very
very
soon
possibly
in
a
week
it
all
depends
on
pyotr
petrovitch
who
will
let
u
know
when
he
ha
had
time
to
look
round
him
in
petersburg
to
suit
his
own
arrangement
he
is
anxious
to
have
the
ceremony
a
soon
a
possible
even
before
the
fast
of
our
lady
if
it
could
be
managed
or
if
that
is
too
soon
to
be
ready
immediately
after
oh
with
what
happiness
i
shall
press
you
to
my
heart
dounia
is
all
excitement
at
the
joyful
thought
of
seeing
you
she
said
one
day
in
joke
that
she
would
be
ready
to
marry
pyotr
petrovitch
for
that
alone
she
is
an
angel
she
is
not
writing
anything
to
you
now
and
ha
only
told
me
to
write
that
she
ha
so
much
so
much
to
tell
you
that
she
is
not
going
to
take
up
her
pen
now
for
a
few
line
would
tell
you
nothing
and
it
would
only
mean
upsetting
herself
she
bid
me
send
you
her
love
and
innumerable
kiss
but
although
we
shall
be
meeting
so
soon
perhaps
i
shall
send
you
a
much
money
a
i
can
in
a
day
or
two
now
that
everyone
ha
heard
that
dounia
is
to
marry
pyotr
petrovitch
my
credit
ha
suddenly
improved
and
i
know
that
afanasy
ivanovitch
will
trust
me
now
even
to
rouble
on
the
security
of
my
pension
so
that
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
send
you
or
even
thirty
rouble
i
would
send
you
more
but
i
am
uneasy
about
our
travelling
expense
for
though
pyotr
petrovitch
ha
been
so
kind
a
to
undertake
part
of
the
expense
of
the
journey
that
is
to
say
he
ha
taken
upon
himself
the
conveyance
of
our
bag
and
big
trunk
which
will
be
conveyed
through
some
acquaintance
of
his
we
must
reckon
upon
some
expense
on
our
arrival
in
petersburg
where
we
can
t
be
left
without
a
halfpenny
at
least
for
the
first
few
day
but
we
have
calculated
it
all
dounia
and
i
to
the
last
penny
and
we
see
that
the
journey
will
not
cost
very
much
it
is
only
ninety
verst
from
u
to
the
railway
and
we
have
come
to
an
agreement
with
a
driver
we
know
so
a
to
be
in
readiness
and
from
there
dounia
and
i
can
travel
quite
comfortably
third
class
so
that
i
may
very
likely
be
able
to
send
to
you
not
but
thirty
rouble
but
enough
i
have
covered
two
sheet
already
and
there
is
no
space
left
for
more
our
whole
history
but
so
many
event
have
happened
and
now
my
precious
rodya
i
embrace
you
and
send
you
a
mother
s
blessing
till
we
meet
love
dounia
your
sister
rodya
love
her
a
she
love
you
and
understand
that
she
love
you
beyond
everything
more
than
herself
she
is
an
angel
and
you
rodya
you
are
everything
to
u
our
one
hope
our
one
consolation
if
only
you
are
happy
we
shall
be
happy
do
you
still
say
your
prayer
rodya
and
believe
in
the
mercy
of
our
creator
and
our
redeemer
i
am
afraid
in
my
heart
that
you
may
have
been
visited
by
the
new
spirit
of
infidelity
that
is
abroad
if
it
is
so
i
pray
for
you
remember
dear
boy
how
in
your
childhood
when
your
father
wa
living
you
used
to
lisp
your
prayer
at
my
knee
and
how
happy
we
all
were
in
those
day
till
we
meet
then
i
embrace
you
warmly
warmly
with
many
kiss
yours
till
death
pulcheria
almost
from
the
first
while
he
read
the
letter
raskolnikov
s
face
wa
wet
with
tear
but
when
he
finished
it
his
face
wa
pale
and
distorted
and
a
bitter
wrathful
and
malignant
smile
wa
on
his
lip
he
laid
his
head
down
on
his
threadbare
dirty
pillow
and
pondered
pondered
a
long
time
his
heart
wa
beating
violently
and
his
brain
wa
in
a
turmoil
at
last
he
felt
cramped
and
stifled
in
the
little
yellow
room
that
wa
like
a
cupboard
or
a
box
his
eye
and
his
mind
craved
for
space
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
this
time
without
dread
of
meeting
anyone
he
had
forgotten
his
dread
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
vassilyevsky
ostrov
walking
along
vassilyevsky
prospect
a
though
hastening
on
some
business
but
he
walked
a
his
habit
wa
without
noticing
his
way
muttering
and
even
speaking
aloud
to
himself
to
the
astonishment
of
the
many
of
them
took
him
to
be
drunk
chapter
iv
his
mother
s
letter
had
been
a
torture
to
him
but
a
regard
the
chief
fact
in
it
he
had
felt
not
one
moment
s
hesitation
even
whilst
he
wa
reading
the
letter
the
essential
question
wa
settled
and
irrevocably
settled
in
his
mind
never
such
a
marriage
while
i
am
alive
and
luzhin
be
damned
the
thing
is
perfectly
clear
he
muttered
to
himself
with
a
malignant
smile
anticipating
the
triumph
of
his
decision
no
mother
no
dounia
you
won
t
deceive
me
and
then
they
apologise
for
not
asking
my
advice
and
for
taking
the
decision
without
me
i
dare
say
they
imagine
it
is
arranged
now
and
can
t
be
broken
off
but
we
will
see
whether
it
can
or
not
a
magnificent
excuse
pyotr
petrovitch
is
such
a
busy
man
that
even
his
wedding
ha
to
be
in
almost
by
no
dounia
i
see
it
all
and
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
to
me
and
i
know
too
what
you
were
thinking
about
when
you
walked
up
and
down
all
night
and
what
your
prayer
were
like
before
the
holy
mother
of
kazan
who
stand
in
mother
s
bedroom
bitter
is
the
ascent
to
golgotha
hm
so
it
is
finally
settled
you
have
determined
to
marry
a
sensible
business
man
avdotya
romanovna
one
who
ha
a
fortune
ha
made
his
fortune
that
is
so
much
more
solid
and
impressive
a
man
who
hold
two
government
post
and
who
share
the
idea
of
our
most
rising
generation
a
mother
writes
and
who
to
be
kind
a
dounia
herself
observes
that
beat
everything
and
that
very
dounia
for
that
very
is
marrying
him
splendid
splendid
but
i
should
like
to
know
why
mother
ha
written
to
me
about
our
most
rising
generation
simply
a
a
descriptive
touch
or
with
the
idea
of
prepossessing
me
in
favour
of
luzhin
oh
the
cunning
of
them
i
should
like
to
know
one
thing
more
how
far
they
were
open
with
one
another
that
day
and
night
and
all
this
time
since
wa
it
all
put
into
or
did
both
understand
that
they
had
the
same
thing
at
heart
and
in
their
mind
so
that
there
wa
no
need
to
speak
of
it
aloud
and
better
not
to
speak
of
it
most
likely
it
wa
partly
like
that
from
mother
s
letter
it
s
evident
he
struck
her
a
rude
and
mother
in
her
simplicity
took
her
observation
to
dounia
and
she
wa
sure
to
be
vexed
and
answered
her
i
should
think
so
who
would
not
be
angered
when
it
wa
quite
clear
without
any
naïve
question
and
when
it
wa
understood
that
it
wa
useless
to
discus
it
and
why
doe
she
write
to
me
love
dounia
rodya
and
she
love
you
more
than
herself
ha
she
a
secret
at
sacrificing
her
daughter
to
her
son
you
are
our
one
comfort
you
are
everything
to
oh
mother
his
bitterness
grew
more
and
more
intense
and
if
he
had
happened
to
meet
luzhin
at
the
moment
he
might
have
murdered
him
hm
yes
that
s
true
he
continued
pursuing
the
whirling
idea
that
chased
each
other
in
his
brain
it
is
true
that
it
need
time
and
care
to
get
to
know
a
man
but
there
is
no
mistake
about
luzhin
the
chief
thing
is
he
is
a
man
of
business
and
kind
that
wa
something
wasn
t
it
to
send
the
bag
and
big
box
for
them
a
kind
man
no
doubt
after
that
but
his
and
her
mother
are
to
drive
in
a
peasant
s
cart
covered
with
sacking
i
know
i
have
been
driven
in
it
no
matter
it
is
only
ninety
verst
and
then
they
can
travel
very
comfortably
third
class
for
a
thousand
verst
quite
right
too
one
must
cut
one
s
coat
according
to
one
s
cloth
but
what
about
you
luzhin
she
is
your
bride
and
you
must
be
aware
that
her
mother
ha
to
raise
money
on
her
pension
for
the
journey
to
be
sure
it
s
a
matter
of
business
a
partnership
for
mutual
benefit
with
equal
share
and
expense
food
and
drink
provided
but
pay
for
your
tobacco
the
business
man
ha
got
the
better
of
them
too
the
luggage
will
cost
less
than
their
fare
and
very
likely
go
for
nothing
how
is
it
that
they
don
t
both
see
all
that
or
is
it
that
they
don
t
want
to
see
and
they
are
pleased
pleased
and
to
think
that
this
is
only
the
first
blossoming
and
that
the
real
fruit
are
to
come
but
what
really
matter
is
not
the
stinginess
is
not
the
meanness
but
the
of
the
whole
thing
for
that
will
be
the
tone
after
marriage
it
s
a
foretaste
of
it
and
mother
too
why
should
she
be
so
lavish
what
will
she
have
by
the
time
she
get
to
petersburg
three
silver
rouble
or
two
paper
one
a
say
that
old
woman
hm
what
doe
she
expect
to
live
upon
in
petersburg
afterwards
she
ha
her
reason
already
for
guessing
that
she
live
with
dounia
after
the
marriage
even
for
the
first
few
month
the
good
man
ha
no
doubt
let
slip
something
on
that
subject
also
though
mother
would
deny
it
i
shall
refuse
say
she
on
whom
is
she
reckoning
then
is
she
counting
on
what
is
left
of
her
hundred
and
twenty
rouble
of
pension
when
afanasy
ivanovitch
s
debt
is
paid
she
knit
woollen
shawl
and
embroiders
cuff
ruining
her
old
eye
and
all
her
shawl
don
t
add
more
than
twenty
rouble
a
year
to
her
hundred
and
twenty
i
know
that
so
she
is
building
all
her
hope
all
the
time
on
luzhin
s
generosity
he
will
offer
it
of
himself
he
will
press
it
on
you
may
wait
a
long
time
for
that
that
s
how
it
always
is
with
these
schilleresque
noble
heart
till
the
last
moment
every
goose
is
a
swan
with
them
till
the
last
moment
they
hope
for
the
best
and
will
see
nothing
wrong
and
although
they
have
an
inkling
of
the
other
side
of
the
picture
yet
they
won
t
face
the
truth
till
they
are
forced
to
the
very
thought
of
it
make
them
shiver
they
thrust
the
truth
away
with
both
hand
until
the
man
they
deck
out
in
false
colour
put
a
fool
s
cap
on
them
with
his
own
hand
i
should
like
to
know
whether
luzhin
ha
any
order
of
merit
i
bet
he
ha
the
anna
in
his
buttonhole
and
that
he
put
it
on
when
he
go
to
dine
with
contractor
or
merchant
he
will
be
sure
to
have
it
for
his
wedding
too
enough
of
him
confound
him
well
mother
i
don
t
wonder
at
it
s
like
her
god
bless
her
but
how
could
dounia
dounia
darling
a
though
i
did
not
know
you
you
were
nearly
twenty
when
i
saw
you
last
i
understood
you
then
mother
writes
that
dounia
can
put
up
with
a
great
i
know
that
very
well
i
knew
that
two
year
and
a
half
ago
and
for
the
last
two
and
a
half
year
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
thinking
of
just
that
that
dounia
can
put
up
with
a
great
if
she
could
put
up
with
svidrigaïlov
and
all
the
rest
of
it
she
certainly
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
and
now
mother
and
she
have
taken
it
into
their
head
that
she
can
put
up
with
luzhin
who
propounds
the
theory
of
the
superiority
of
wife
raised
from
destitution
and
owing
everything
to
their
husband
s
bounty
who
propounds
it
too
almost
at
the
first
interview
granted
that
he
let
it
slip
though
he
is
a
sensible
man
yet
maybe
it
wa
not
a
slip
at
all
but
he
meant
to
make
himself
clear
a
soon
a
possible
but
dounia
dounia
she
understands
the
man
of
course
but
she
will
have
to
live
with
the
man
why
she
d
live
on
black
bread
and
water
she
would
not
sell
her
soul
she
would
not
barter
her
moral
freedom
for
comfort
she
would
not
barter
it
for
all
much
less
luzhin
s
money
no
dounia
wa
not
that
sort
when
i
knew
her
and
she
is
still
the
same
of
course
yes
there
s
no
denying
the
svidrigaïlovs
are
a
bitter
pill
it
s
a
bitter
thing
to
spend
one
s
life
a
governess
in
the
province
for
two
hundred
rouble
but
i
know
she
would
rather
be
a
nigger
on
a
plantation
or
a
lett
with
a
german
master
than
degrade
her
soul
and
her
moral
dignity
by
binding
herself
for
ever
to
a
man
whom
she
doe
not
respect
and
with
whom
she
ha
nothing
in
common
for
her
own
advantage
and
if
luzhin
had
been
of
unalloyed
gold
or
one
huge
diamond
she
would
never
have
consented
to
become
his
legal
concubine
why
is
she
consenting
then
what
s
the
point
of
it
what
s
the
answer
it
s
clear
enough
for
herself
for
her
comfort
to
save
her
life
she
would
not
sell
herself
but
for
someone
else
she
is
doing
it
for
one
she
love
for
one
she
adores
she
will
sell
herself
that
s
what
it
all
amount
to
for
her
brother
for
her
mother
she
will
sell
herself
she
will
sell
everything
in
such
case
we
overcome
our
moral
feeling
if
necessary
freedom
peace
conscience
even
all
all
are
brought
into
the
market
let
my
life
go
if
only
my
dear
one
may
be
happy
more
than
that
we
become
casuist
we
learn
to
be
jesuitical
and
for
a
time
maybe
we
can
soothe
ourselves
we
can
persuade
ourselves
that
it
is
one
s
duty
for
a
good
object
that
s
just
like
u
it
s
a
clear
a
daylight
it
s
clear
that
rodion
romanovitch
raskolnikov
is
the
central
figure
in
the
business
and
no
one
else
oh
yes
she
can
ensure
his
happiness
keep
him
in
the
university
make
him
a
partner
in
the
office
make
his
whole
future
secure
perhaps
he
may
even
be
a
rich
man
later
on
prosperous
respected
and
may
even
end
his
life
a
famous
man
but
my
mother
it
s
all
rodya
precious
rodya
her
first
born
for
such
a
son
who
would
not
sacrifice
such
a
daughter
oh
loving
heart
why
for
his
sake
we
would
not
shrink
even
from
sonia
s
fate
sonia
sonia
marmeladov
the
eternal
victim
so
long
a
the
world
last
have
you
taken
the
measure
of
your
sacrifice
both
of
you
is
it
right
can
you
bear
it
is
it
any
use
is
there
sense
in
it
and
let
me
tell
you
dounia
sonia
s
life
is
no
worse
than
life
with
luzhin
there
can
be
no
question
of
love
mother
writes
and
what
if
there
can
be
no
respect
either
if
on
the
contrary
there
is
aversion
contempt
repulsion
what
then
so
you
will
have
to
keep
up
your
appearance
too
is
not
that
so
do
you
understand
what
that
smartness
mean
do
you
understand
that
the
luzhin
smartness
is
just
the
same
thing
a
sonia
s
and
may
be
worse
viler
baser
because
in
your
case
dounia
it
s
a
bargain
for
luxury
after
all
but
with
sonia
it
s
simply
a
question
of
starvation
it
ha
to
be
paid
for
it
ha
to
be
paid
for
dounia
this
smartness
and
what
if
it
s
more
than
you
can
bear
afterwards
if
you
regret
it
the
bitterness
the
misery
the
curse
the
tear
hidden
from
all
the
world
for
you
are
not
a
marfa
petrovna
and
how
will
your
mother
feel
then
even
now
she
is
uneasy
she
is
worried
but
then
when
she
see
it
all
clearly
and
i
yes
indeed
what
have
you
taken
me
for
i
won
t
have
your
sacrifice
dounia
i
won
t
have
it
mother
it
shall
not
be
so
long
a
i
am
alive
it
shall
not
it
shall
not
i
won
t
accept
it
he
suddenly
paused
in
his
reflection
and
stood
still
it
shall
not
be
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
prevent
it
you
ll
forbid
it
and
what
right
have
you
what
can
you
promise
them
on
your
side
to
give
you
such
a
right
your
whole
life
your
whole
future
you
will
devote
to
them
you
have
finished
your
study
and
obtained
a
yes
we
have
heard
all
that
before
and
that
s
all
but
now
now
something
must
be
done
now
do
you
understand
that
and
what
are
you
doing
now
you
are
living
upon
them
they
borrow
on
their
hundred
rouble
pension
they
borrow
from
the
svidrigaïlovs
how
are
you
going
to
save
them
from
svidrigaïlovs
from
afanasy
ivanovitch
vahrushin
oh
future
millionaire
zeus
who
would
arrange
their
life
for
them
in
another
ten
year
in
another
ten
year
mother
will
be
blind
with
knitting
shawl
maybe
with
weeping
too
she
will
be
worn
to
a
shadow
with
fasting
and
my
sister
imagine
for
a
moment
what
may
have
become
of
your
sister
in
ten
year
what
may
happen
to
her
during
those
ten
year
can
you
fancy
so
he
tortured
himself
fretting
himself
with
such
question
and
finding
a
kind
of
enjoyment
in
it
and
yet
all
these
question
were
not
new
one
suddenly
confronting
him
they
were
old
familiar
ache
it
wa
long
since
they
had
first
begun
to
grip
and
rend
his
heart
long
long
ago
his
present
anguish
had
it
first
beginning
it
had
waxed
and
gathered
strength
it
had
matured
and
concentrated
until
it
had
taken
the
form
of
a
fearful
frenzied
and
fantastic
question
which
tortured
his
heart
and
mind
clamouring
insistently
for
an
answer
now
his
mother
s
letter
had
burst
on
him
like
a
thunderclap
it
wa
clear
that
he
must
not
now
suffer
passively
worrying
himself
over
unsolved
question
but
that
he
must
do
something
do
it
at
once
and
do
it
quickly
anyway
he
must
decide
on
something
or
else
or
throw
up
life
altogether
he
cried
suddenly
in
a
frenzy
accept
one
s
lot
humbly
a
it
is
once
for
all
and
stifle
everything
in
oneself
giving
up
all
claim
to
activity
life
and
love
do
you
understand
sir
do
you
understand
what
it
mean
when
you
have
absolutely
nowhere
to
turn
marmeladov
s
question
came
suddenly
into
his
mind
for
every
man
must
have
somewhere
to
turn
he
gave
a
sudden
start
another
thought
that
he
had
had
yesterday
slipped
back
into
his
mind
but
he
did
not
start
at
the
thought
recurring
to
him
for
he
knew
he
had
that
it
must
come
back
he
wa
expecting
it
besides
it
wa
not
only
yesterday
s
thought
the
difference
wa
that
a
month
ago
yesterday
even
the
thought
wa
a
mere
dream
but
now
now
it
appeared
not
a
dream
at
all
it
had
taken
a
new
menacing
and
quite
unfamiliar
shape
and
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
this
himself
he
felt
a
hammering
in
his
head
and
there
wa
a
darkness
before
his
eye
he
looked
round
hurriedly
he
wa
searching
for
something
he
wanted
to
sit
down
and
wa
looking
for
a
seat
he
wa
walking
along
the
k
boulevard
there
wa
a
seat
about
a
hundred
pace
in
front
of
him
he
walked
towards
it
a
fast
he
could
but
on
the
way
he
met
with
a
little
adventure
which
absorbed
all
his
attention
looking
for
the
seat
he
had
noticed
a
woman
walking
some
twenty
pace
in
front
of
him
but
at
first
he
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
of
other
object
that
crossed
his
path
it
had
happened
to
him
many
time
going
home
not
to
notice
the
road
by
which
he
wa
going
and
he
wa
accustomed
to
walk
like
that
but
there
wa
at
first
sight
something
so
strange
about
the
woman
in
front
of
him
that
gradually
his
attention
wa
riveted
upon
her
at
first
reluctantly
and
a
it
were
resentfully
and
then
more
and
more
intently
he
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
find
out
what
it
wa
that
wa
so
strange
about
the
woman
in
the
first
place
she
appeared
to
be
a
girl
quite
young
and
she
wa
walking
in
the
great
heat
bareheaded
and
with
no
parasol
or
glove
waving
her
arm
about
in
an
absurd
way
she
had
on
a
dress
of
some
light
silky
material
but
put
on
strangely
awry
not
properly
hooked
up
and
torn
open
at
the
top
of
the
skirt
close
to
the
waist
a
great
piece
wa
rent
and
hanging
loose
a
little
kerchief
wa
flung
about
her
bare
throat
but
lay
slanting
on
one
side
the
girl
wa
walking
unsteadily
too
stumbling
and
staggering
from
side
to
side
she
drew
raskolnikov
s
whole
attention
at
last
he
overtook
the
girl
at
the
seat
but
on
reaching
it
she
dropped
down
on
it
in
the
corner
she
let
her
head
sink
on
the
back
of
the
seat
and
closed
her
eye
apparently
in
extreme
exhaustion
looking
at
her
closely
he
saw
at
once
that
she
wa
completely
drunk
it
wa
a
strange
and
shocking
sight
he
could
hardly
believe
that
he
wa
not
mistaken
he
saw
before
him
the
face
of
a
quite
young
girl
sixteen
perhaps
not
more
than
fifteen
year
old
pretty
little
face
but
flushed
and
heavy
looking
and
a
it
were
swollen
the
girl
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
she
wa
doing
she
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
lifting
it
indecorously
and
showed
every
sign
of
being
unconscious
that
she
wa
in
the
street
raskolnikov
did
not
sit
down
but
he
felt
unwilling
to
leave
her
and
stood
facing
her
in
perplexity
this
boulevard
wa
never
much
frequented
and
now
at
two
o
clock
in
the
stifling
heat
it
wa
quite
deserted
and
yet
on
the
further
side
of
the
boulevard
about
fifteen
pace
away
a
gentleman
wa
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
he
too
would
apparently
have
liked
to
approach
the
girl
with
some
object
of
his
own
he
too
had
probably
seen
her
in
the
distance
and
had
followed
her
but
found
raskolnikov
in
his
way
he
looked
angrily
at
him
though
he
tried
to
escape
his
notice
and
stood
impatiently
biding
his
time
till
the
unwelcome
man
in
rag
should
have
moved
away
his
intention
were
unmistakable
the
gentleman
wa
a
plump
man
about
thirty
fashionably
dressed
with
a
high
colour
red
lip
and
moustache
raskolnikov
felt
furious
he
had
a
sudden
longing
to
insult
this
fat
dandy
in
some
way
he
left
the
girl
for
a
moment
and
walked
towards
the
gentleman
hey
you
svidrigaïlov
what
do
you
want
here
he
shouted
clenching
his
fist
and
laughing
spluttering
with
rage
what
do
you
mean
the
gentleman
asked
sternly
scowling
in
haughty
astonishment
get
away
that
s
what
i
how
dare
you
you
low
fellow
he
raised
his
cane
raskolnikov
rushed
at
him
with
his
fist
without
reflecting
that
the
stout
gentleman
wa
a
match
for
two
men
like
himself
but
at
that
instant
someone
seized
him
from
behind
and
a
police
constable
stood
between
them
that
s
enough
gentleman
no
fighting
please
in
a
public
place
what
do
you
want
who
are
you
he
asked
raskolnikov
sternly
noticing
his
rag
raskolnikov
looked
at
him
intently
he
had
a
sensible
soldierly
face
with
grey
moustache
and
whisker
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
raskolnikov
cried
catching
at
his
arm
i
am
a
student
raskolnikov
you
may
a
well
know
that
too
he
added
addressing
the
gentleman
come
along
i
have
something
to
show
and
taking
the
policeman
by
the
hand
he
drew
him
towards
the
seat
look
here
hopelessly
drunk
and
she
ha
just
come
down
the
boulevard
there
is
no
telling
who
and
what
she
is
she
doe
not
look
like
a
professional
it
s
more
likely
she
ha
been
given
drink
and
deceived
somewhere
for
the
first
time
you
understand
and
they
ve
put
her
out
into
the
street
like
that
look
at
the
way
her
dress
is
torn
and
the
way
it
ha
been
put
on
she
ha
been
dressed
by
somebody
she
ha
not
dressed
herself
and
dressed
by
unpractised
hand
by
a
man
s
hand
that
s
evident
and
now
look
there
i
don
t
know
that
dandy
with
whom
i
wa
going
to
fight
i
see
him
for
the
first
time
but
he
too
ha
seen
her
on
the
road
just
now
drunk
not
knowing
what
she
is
doing
and
now
he
is
very
eager
to
get
hold
of
her
to
get
her
away
somewhere
while
she
is
in
this
state
that
s
certain
believe
me
i
am
not
wrong
i
saw
him
myself
watching
her
and
following
her
but
i
prevented
him
and
he
is
just
waiting
for
me
to
go
away
now
he
ha
walked
away
a
little
and
is
standing
still
pretending
to
make
a
cigarette
think
how
can
we
keep
her
out
of
his
hand
and
how
are
we
to
get
her
home
the
policeman
saw
it
all
in
a
flash
the
stout
gentleman
wa
easy
to
understand
he
turned
to
consider
the
girl
the
policeman
bent
over
to
examine
her
more
closely
and
his
face
worked
with
genuine
compassion
ah
what
a
pity
he
said
shaking
his
head
why
she
is
quite
a
child
she
ha
been
deceived
you
can
see
that
at
once
listen
lady
he
began
addressing
her
where
do
you
live
the
girl
opened
her
weary
and
eye
gazed
blankly
at
the
speaker
and
waved
her
hand
here
said
raskolnikov
feeling
in
his
pocket
and
finding
twenty
copeck
here
call
a
cab
and
tell
him
to
drive
her
to
her
address
the
only
thing
is
to
find
out
her
address
missy
missy
the
policeman
began
again
taking
the
money
i
ll
fetch
you
a
cab
and
take
you
home
myself
where
shall
i
take
you
eh
where
do
you
live
go
away
they
won
t
let
me
alone
the
girl
muttered
and
once
more
waved
her
hand
ach
ach
how
shocking
it
s
shameful
missy
it
s
a
shame
he
shook
his
head
again
shocked
sympathetic
and
indignant
it
s
a
difficult
job
the
policeman
said
to
raskolnikov
and
a
he
did
so
he
looked
him
up
and
down
in
a
rapid
glance
he
too
must
have
seemed
a
strange
figure
to
him
dressed
in
rag
and
handing
him
money
did
you
meet
her
far
from
here
he
asked
him
i
tell
you
she
wa
walking
in
front
of
me
staggering
just
here
in
the
boulevard
she
only
just
reached
the
seat
and
sank
down
on
ah
the
shameful
thing
that
are
done
in
the
world
nowadays
god
have
mercy
on
u
an
innocent
creature
like
that
drunk
already
she
ha
been
deceived
that
s
a
sure
thing
see
how
her
dress
ha
been
torn
too
ah
the
vice
one
see
nowadays
and
a
likely
a
not
she
belongs
to
gentlefolk
too
poor
one
maybe
there
are
many
like
that
nowadays
she
look
refined
too
a
though
she
were
a
lady
and
he
bent
over
her
once
more
perhaps
he
had
daughter
growing
up
like
that
looking
like
lady
and
refined
with
pretension
to
gentility
and
smartness
the
chief
thing
is
raskolnikov
persisted
to
keep
her
out
of
this
scoundrel
s
hand
why
should
he
outrage
her
it
s
a
clear
a
day
what
he
is
after
ah
the
brute
he
is
not
moving
off
raskolnikov
spoke
aloud
and
pointed
to
him
the
gentleman
heard
him
and
seemed
about
to
fly
into
a
rage
again
but
thought
better
of
it
and
confined
himself
to
a
contemptuous
look
he
then
walked
slowly
another
ten
pace
away
and
again
halted
keep
her
out
of
his
hand
we
can
said
the
constable
thoughtfully
if
only
she
d
tell
u
where
to
take
her
but
a
it
is
missy
hey
missy
he
bent
over
her
once
more
she
opened
her
eye
fully
all
of
a
sudden
looked
at
him
intently
a
though
realising
something
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
oh
shameful
wretch
they
won
t
let
me
alone
she
said
waving
her
hand
again
she
walked
quickly
though
staggering
a
before
the
dandy
followed
her
but
along
another
avenue
keeping
his
eye
on
her
don
t
be
anxious
i
won
t
let
him
have
her
the
policeman
said
resolutely
and
he
set
off
after
them
ah
the
vice
one
see
nowadays
he
repeated
aloud
sighing
at
that
moment
something
seemed
to
sting
raskolnikov
in
an
instant
a
complete
revulsion
of
feeling
came
over
him
hey
here
he
shouted
after
the
policeman
the
latter
turned
round
let
them
be
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
let
her
go
let
him
amuse
he
pointed
at
the
dandy
what
is
it
to
do
with
you
the
policeman
wa
bewildered
and
stared
at
him
raskolnikov
laughed
well
ejaculated
the
policeman
with
a
gesture
of
contempt
and
he
walked
after
the
dandy
and
the
girl
probably
taking
raskolnikov
for
a
madman
or
something
even
worse
he
ha
carried
off
my
twenty
copeck
raskolnikov
murmured
angrily
when
he
wa
left
alone
well
let
him
take
a
much
from
the
other
fellow
to
allow
him
to
have
the
girl
and
so
let
it
end
and
why
did
i
want
to
interfere
is
it
for
me
to
help
have
i
any
right
to
help
let
them
devour
each
other
alive
what
is
it
to
me
how
did
i
dare
to
give
him
twenty
copeck
were
they
mine
in
spite
of
those
strange
word
he
felt
very
wretched
he
sat
down
on
the
deserted
seat
his
thought
strayed
aimlessly
he
found
it
hard
to
fix
his
mind
on
anything
at
that
moment
he
longed
to
forget
himself
altogether
to
forget
everything
and
then
to
wake
up
and
begin
life
anew
poor
girl
he
said
looking
at
the
empty
corner
where
she
had
sat
she
will
come
to
herself
and
weep
and
then
her
mother
will
find
out
she
will
give
her
a
beating
a
horrible
shameful
beating
and
then
maybe
turn
her
out
of
door
and
even
if
she
doe
not
the
darya
frantsovnas
will
get
wind
of
it
and
the
girl
will
soon
be
slipping
out
on
the
sly
here
and
there
then
there
will
be
the
hospital
directly
that
s
always
the
luck
of
those
girl
with
respectable
mother
who
go
wrong
on
the
sly
and
then
again
the
hospital
drink
the
tavern
and
more
hospital
in
two
or
three
year
a
wreck
and
her
life
over
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
have
not
i
seen
case
like
that
and
how
have
they
been
brought
to
it
why
they
ve
all
come
to
it
like
that
ugh
but
what
doe
it
matter
that
s
a
it
should
be
they
tell
u
a
certain
percentage
they
tell
u
must
every
year
go
that
way
to
the
devil
i
suppose
so
that
the
rest
may
remain
chaste
and
not
be
interfered
with
a
percentage
what
splendid
word
they
have
they
are
so
scientific
so
consolatory
once
you
ve
said
percentage
there
s
nothing
more
to
worry
about
if
we
had
any
other
word
maybe
we
might
feel
more
uneasy
but
what
if
dounia
were
one
of
the
percentage
of
another
one
if
not
that
one
but
where
am
i
going
he
thought
suddenly
strange
i
came
out
for
something
a
soon
a
i
had
read
the
letter
i
came
out
i
wa
going
to
vassilyevsky
ostrov
to
razumihin
that
s
what
it
wa
now
i
remember
what
for
though
and
what
put
the
idea
of
going
to
razumihin
into
my
head
just
now
that
s
he
wondered
at
himself
razumihin
wa
one
of
his
old
comrade
at
the
university
it
wa
remarkable
that
raskolnikov
had
hardly
any
friend
at
the
university
he
kept
aloof
from
everyone
went
to
see
no
one
and
did
not
welcome
anyone
who
came
to
see
him
and
indeed
everyone
soon
gave
him
up
he
took
no
part
in
the
student
gathering
amusement
or
conversation
he
worked
with
great
intensity
without
sparing
himself
and
he
wa
respected
for
this
but
no
one
liked
him
he
wa
very
poor
and
there
wa
a
sort
of
haughty
pride
and
reserve
about
him
a
though
he
were
keeping
something
to
himself
he
seemed
to
some
of
his
comrade
to
look
down
upon
them
all
a
child
a
though
he
were
superior
in
development
knowledge
and
conviction
a
though
their
belief
and
interest
were
beneath
him
with
razumihin
he
had
got
on
or
at
least
he
wa
more
unreserved
and
communicative
with
him
indeed
it
wa
impossible
to
be
on
any
other
term
with
razumihin
he
wa
an
exceptionally
and
candid
youth
to
the
point
of
simplicity
though
both
depth
and
dignity
lay
concealed
under
that
simplicity
the
better
of
his
comrade
understood
this
and
all
were
fond
of
him
he
wa
extremely
intelligent
though
he
wa
certainly
rather
a
simpleton
at
time
he
wa
of
striking
appearance
tall
thin
and
always
badly
shaved
he
wa
sometimes
uproarious
and
wa
reputed
to
be
of
great
physical
strength
one
night
when
out
in
a
festive
company
he
had
with
one
blow
laid
a
gigantic
policeman
on
his
back
there
wa
no
limit
to
his
drinking
power
but
he
could
abstain
from
drink
altogether
he
sometimes
went
too
far
in
his
prank
but
he
could
do
without
prank
altogether
another
thing
striking
about
razumihin
no
failure
distressed
him
and
it
seemed
a
though
no
unfavourable
circumstance
could
crush
him
he
could
lodge
anywhere
and
bear
the
extreme
of
cold
and
hunger
he
wa
very
poor
and
kept
himself
entirely
on
what
he
could
earn
by
work
of
one
sort
or
another
he
knew
of
no
end
of
resource
by
which
to
earn
money
he
spent
one
whole
winter
without
lighting
his
stove
and
used
to
declare
that
he
liked
it
better
because
one
slept
more
soundly
in
the
cold
for
the
present
he
too
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
university
but
it
wa
only
for
a
time
and
he
wa
working
with
all
his
might
to
save
enough
to
return
to
his
study
again
raskolnikov
had
not
been
to
see
him
for
the
last
four
month
and
razumihin
did
not
even
know
his
address
about
two
month
before
they
had
met
in
the
street
but
raskolnikov
had
turned
away
and
even
crossed
to
the
other
side
that
he
might
not
be
observed
and
though
razumihin
noticed
him
he
passed
him
by
a
he
did
not
want
to
annoy
him
chapter
v
of
course
i
ve
been
meaning
lately
to
go
to
razumihin
s
to
ask
for
work
to
ask
him
to
get
me
lesson
or
something
raskolnikov
thought
but
what
help
can
he
be
to
me
now
suppose
he
get
me
lesson
suppose
he
share
his
last
farthing
with
me
if
he
ha
any
farthing
so
that
i
could
get
some
boot
and
make
myself
tidy
enough
to
give
lesson
hm
well
and
what
then
what
shall
i
do
with
the
few
copper
i
earn
that
s
not
what
i
want
now
it
s
really
absurd
for
me
to
go
to
razumihin
the
question
why
he
wa
now
going
to
razumihin
agitated
him
even
more
than
he
wa
himself
aware
he
kept
uneasily
seeking
for
some
sinister
significance
in
this
apparently
ordinary
action
could
i
have
expected
to
set
it
all
straight
and
to
find
a
way
out
by
mean
of
razumihin
alone
he
asked
himself
in
perplexity
he
pondered
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
strange
to
say
after
long
musing
suddenly
a
if
it
were
spontaneously
and
by
chance
a
fantastic
thought
came
into
his
head
hm
to
razumihin
s
he
said
all
at
once
calmly
a
though
he
had
reached
a
final
determination
i
shall
go
to
razumihin
s
of
course
but
not
now
i
shall
go
to
him
on
the
next
day
after
it
when
it
will
be
over
and
everything
will
begin
afresh
and
suddenly
he
realised
what
he
wa
thinking
after
it
he
shouted
jumping
up
from
the
seat
but
is
it
really
going
to
happen
is
it
possible
it
really
will
happen
he
left
the
seat
and
went
off
almost
at
a
run
he
meant
to
turn
back
homewards
but
the
thought
of
going
home
suddenly
filled
him
with
intense
loathing
in
that
hole
in
that
awful
little
cupboard
of
his
all
had
for
a
month
past
been
growing
up
in
him
and
he
walked
on
at
random
his
nervous
shudder
had
passed
into
a
fever
that
made
him
feel
shivering
in
spite
of
the
heat
he
felt
cold
with
a
kind
of
effort
he
began
almost
unconsciously
from
some
inner
craving
to
stare
at
all
the
object
before
him
a
though
looking
for
something
to
distract
his
attention
but
he
did
not
succeed
and
kept
dropping
every
moment
into
brooding
when
with
a
start
he
lifted
his
head
again
and
looked
round
he
forgot
at
once
what
he
had
just
been
thinking
about
and
even
where
he
wa
going
in
this
way
he
walked
right
across
vassilyevsky
ostrov
came
out
on
to
the
lesser
neva
crossed
the
bridge
and
turned
towards
the
island
the
greenness
and
freshness
were
at
first
restful
to
his
weary
eye
after
the
dust
of
the
town
and
the
huge
house
that
hemmed
him
in
and
weighed
upon
him
here
there
were
no
tavern
no
stifling
closeness
no
stench
but
soon
these
new
pleasant
sensation
passed
into
morbid
irritability
sometimes
he
stood
still
before
a
brightly
painted
summer
villa
standing
among
green
foliage
he
gazed
through
the
fence
he
saw
in
the
distance
smartly
dressed
woman
on
the
verandah
and
balcony
and
child
running
in
the
garden
the
flower
especially
caught
his
attention
he
gazed
at
them
longer
than
at
anything
he
wa
met
too
by
luxurious
carriage
and
by
men
and
woman
on
horseback
he
watched
them
with
curious
eye
and
forgot
about
them
before
they
had
vanished
from
his
sight
once
he
stood
still
and
counted
his
money
he
found
he
had
thirty
copeck
twenty
to
the
policeman
three
to
nastasya
for
the
letter
so
i
must
have
given
or
fifty
to
the
marmeladovs
yesterday
he
thought
reckoning
it
up
for
some
unknown
reason
but
he
soon
forgot
with
what
object
he
had
taken
the
money
out
of
his
pocket
he
recalled
it
on
passing
an
or
tavern
and
felt
that
he
wa
hungry
going
into
the
tavern
he
drank
a
glass
of
vodka
and
ate
a
pie
of
some
sort
he
finished
eating
it
a
he
walked
away
it
wa
a
long
while
since
he
had
taken
vodka
and
it
had
an
effect
upon
him
at
once
though
he
only
drank
a
wineglassful
his
leg
felt
suddenly
heavy
and
a
great
drowsiness
came
upon
him
he
turned
homewards
but
reaching
petrovsky
ostrov
he
stopped
completely
exhausted
turned
off
the
road
into
the
bush
sank
down
upon
the
grass
and
instantly
fell
asleep
in
a
morbid
condition
of
the
brain
dream

a
singular
actuality
vividness
and
extraordinary
semblance
of
reality
at
time
monstrous
image
are
created
but
the
setting
and
the
whole
picture
are
so
and
filled
with
detail
so
delicate
so
unexpectedly
but
so
artistically
consistent
that
the
dreamer
were
he
an
artist
like
pushkin
or
turgenev
even
could
never
have
invented
them
in
the
waking
state
such
sick
dream
always
remain
long
in
the
memory
and
make
a
powerful
impression
on
the
overwrought
and
deranged
nervous
system
raskolnikov
had
a
fearful
dream
he
dreamt
he
wa
back
in
his
childhood
in
the
little
town
of
his
birth
he
wa
a
child
about
seven
year
old
walking
into
the
country
with
his
father
on
the
evening
of
a
holiday
it
wa
a
grey
and
heavy
day
the
country
wa
exactly
a
he
remembered
it
indeed
he
recalled
it
far
more
vividly
in
his
dream
than
he
had
done
in
memory
the
little
town
stood
on
a
level
flat
a
bare
a
the
hand
not
even
a
willow
near
it
only
in
the
far
distance
a
copse
lay
a
dark
blur
on
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
a
few
pace
beyond
the
last
market
garden
stood
a
tavern
a
big
tavern
which
had
always
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
of
aversion
even
of
fear
when
he
walked
by
it
with
his
father
there
wa
always
a
crowd
there
always
shouting
laughter
and
abuse
hideous
hoarse
singing
and
often
fighting
drunken
and
figure
were
hanging
about
the
tavern
he
used
to
cling
close
to
his
father
trembling
all
over
when
he
met
them
near
the
tavern
the
road
became
a
dusty
track
the
dust
of
which
wa
always
black
it
wa
a
winding
road
and
about
a
hundred
pace
further
on
it
turned
to
the
right
to
the
graveyard
in
the
middle
of
the
graveyard
stood
a
stone
church
with
a
green
cupola
where
he
used
to
go
to
mass
two
or
three
time
a
year
with
his
father
and
mother
when
a
service
wa
held
in
memory
of
his
grandmother
who
had
long
been
dead
and
whom
he
had
never
seen
on
these
occasion
they
used
to
take
on
a
white
dish
tied
up
in
a
table
napkin
a
special
sort
of
rice
pudding
with
raisin
stuck
in
it
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
he
loved
that
church
the
unadorned
ikon
and
the
old
priest
with
the
shaking
head
near
his
grandmother
s
grave
which
wa
marked
by
a
stone
wa
the
little
grave
of
his
younger
brother
who
had
died
at
six
month
old
he
did
not
remember
him
at
all
but
he
had
been
told
about
his
little
brother
and
whenever
he
visited
the
graveyard
he
used
religiously
and
reverently
to
cross
himself
and
to
bow
down
and
kiss
the
little
grave
and
now
he
dreamt
that
he
wa
walking
with
his
father
past
the
tavern
on
the
way
to
the
graveyard
he
wa
holding
his
father
s
hand
and
looking
with
dread
at
the
tavern
a
peculiar
circumstance
attracted
his
attention
there
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
festivity
going
on
there
were
crowd
of
gaily
dressed
townspeople
peasant
woman
their
husband
and
of
all
sort
all
singing
and
all
more
or
less
drunk
near
the
entrance
of
the
tavern
stood
a
cart
but
a
strange
cart
it
wa
one
of
those
big
cart
usually
drawn
by
heavy
and
laden
with
cask
of
wine
or
other
heavy
good
he
always
liked
looking
at
those
great
with
their
long
mane
thick
leg
and
slow
even
pace
drawing
along
a
perfect
mountain
with
no
appearance
of
effort
a
though
it
were
easier
going
with
a
load
than
without
it
but
now
strange
to
say
in
the
shaft
of
such
a
cart
he
saw
a
thin
little
sorrel
beast
one
of
those
peasant
nag
which
he
had
often
seen
straining
their
utmost
under
a
heavy
load
of
wood
or
hay
especially
when
the
wheel
were
stuck
in
the
mud
or
in
a
rut
and
the
peasant
would
beat
them
so
cruelly
sometimes
even
about
the
nose
and
eye
and
he
felt
so
sorry
so
sorry
for
them
that
he
almost
cried
and
his
mother
always
used
to
take
him
away
from
the
window
all
of
a
sudden
there
wa
a
great
uproar
of
shouting
singing
and
the
balalaïka
and
from
the
tavern
a
number
of
big
and
very
drunken
peasant
came
out
wearing
red
and
blue
shirt
and
coat
thrown
over
their
shoulder
get

at

outbreak
of

thick
shaft

it
fell
a
second
time
on
the
spine
of
the
luckless
mare
she
sank
back
on
her
haunch

measured
blow

screamed
frantically
he
threw
down

down
in
the
cart
and
picked
up
an
iron
crowbar
look
out
he
shouted
and
with
all
his
might
he
dealt
a
stunning
blow
at
the
poor
mare
the
blow
fell
the
mare
staggered
sank
back
tried
to
pull
but
the
bar
fell
again
with
a
swinging
blow
on
her
back
and
she
fell
on
the
ground
like
a
log

off
shouted
mikolka
and
he
leapt
beside
himself
out
of
the
cart
several
young
men
also
flushed
with
drink
seized
anything
they
could
come
across
whip
stick
pole
and
ran
to
the
dying
mare
mikolka
stood
on
one
side
and
began
dealing
random
blow
with
the
crowbar
the
mare
stretched
out
her
head
drew
a
long
breath
and
died
you
butchered
her
someone
shouted
in
the
crowd
why
wouldn
t
she
gallop
then
my
property
shouted
mikolka
with
bloodshot
eye
brandishing
the
bar
in
his
hand
he
stood
a
though
regretting
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
beat
no
mistake
about
it
you
are
not
a
christian
many
voice
were
shouting
in
the
crowd
but
the
poor
boy
beside
himself
made
his
way
screaming
through
the
crowd
to
the
sorrel
nag
put
his
arm
round
her
bleeding
dead
head
and
kissed
it
kissed
the
eye
and
kissed
the
lip
then
he
jumped
up
and
flew
in
a
frenzy
with
his
little
fist
out
at
mikolka
at
that
instant
his
father
who
had
been
running
after
him
snatched
him
up
and
carried
him
out
of
the
crowd
come
along
come
let
u
go
home
he
said
to
him
father
why
did
they
kill
the
poor
horse
he
sobbed
but
his
voice
broke
and
the
word
came
in
shriek
from
his
panting
chest
they
are
drunk
they
are
brutal
it
s
not
our
business
said
his
father
he
put
his
arm
round
his
father
but
he
felt
choked
choked
he
tried
to
draw
a
breath
to
cry
out
and
woke
up
he
waked
up
gasping
for
breath
his
hair
soaked
with
perspiration
and
stood
up
in
terror
thank
god
that
wa
only
a
dream
he
said
sitting
down
under
a
tree
and
drawing
deep
breath
but
what
is
it
is
it
some
fever
coming
on
such
a
hideous
dream
he
felt
utterly
broken
darkness
and
confusion
were
in
his
soul
he
rested
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
good
god
he
cried
can
it
be
can
it
be
that
i
shall
really
take
an
axe
that
i
shall
strike
her
on
the
head
split
her
skull
open
that
i
shall
tread
in
the
sticky
warm
blood
break
the
lock
steal
and
tremble
hide
all
spattered
in
the
blood
with
the
axe
good
god
can
it
be
he
wa
shaking
like
a
leaf
a
he
said
this
but
why
am
i
going
on
like
this
he
continued
sitting
up
again
a
it
were
in
profound
amazement
i
knew
that
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
it
so
what
have
i
been
torturing
myself
for
till
now
yesterday
yesterday
when
i
went
to
make
that
yesterday
i
realised
completely
that
i
could
never
bear
to
do
it
why
am
i
going
over
it
again
then
why
am
i
hesitating
a
i
came
down
the
stair
yesterday
i
said
myself
that
it
wa
base
loathsome
vile
vile
the
very
thought
of
it
made
me
feel
sick
and
filled
me
with
horror
no
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
granted
granted
that
there
is
no
flaw
in
all
that
reasoning
that
all
that
i
have
concluded
this
last
month
is
clear
a
day
true
a
arithmetic
my
god
anyway
i
couldn
t
bring
myself
to
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
why
why
then
am
i
still
he
rose
to
his
foot
looked
round
in
wonder
a
though
surprised
at
finding
himself
in
this
place
and
went
towards
the
bridge
he
wa
pale
his
eye
glowed
he
wa
exhausted
in
every
limb
but
he
seemed
suddenly
to
breathe
more
easily
he
felt
he
had
cast
off
that
fearful
burden
that
had
so
long
been
weighing
upon
him
and
all
at
once
there
wa
a
sense
of
relief
and
peace
in
his
soul
lord
he
prayed
show
me
my
path
i
renounce
that
accursed
dream
of
crossing
the
bridge
he
gazed
quietly
and
calmly
at
the
neva
at
the
glowing
red
sun
setting
in
the
glowing
sky
in
spite
of
his
weakness
he
wa
not
conscious
of
fatigue
it
wa
a
though
an
abscess
that
had
been
forming
for
a
month
past
in
his
heart
had
suddenly
broken
freedom
freedom
he
wa
free
from
that
spell
that
sorcery
that
obsession
later
on
when
he
recalled
that
time
and
all
that
happened
to
him
during
those
day
minute
by
minute
point
by
point
he
wa
superstitiously
impressed
by
one
circumstance
which
though
in
itself
not
very
exceptional
always
seemed
to
him
afterwards
the
predestined
of
his
fate
he
could
never
understand
and
explain
to
himself
why
when
he
wa
tired
and
worn
out
when
it
would
have
been
more
convenient
for
him
to
go
home
by
the
shortest
and
most
direct
way
he
had
returned
by
the
hay
market
where
he
had
no
need
to
go
it
wa
obviously
and
quite
unnecessarily
out
of
his
way
though
not
much
so
it
is
true
that
it
happened
to
him
dozen
of
time
to
return
home
without
noticing
what
street
he
passed
through
but
why
he
wa
always
asking
himself
why
had
such
an
important
such
a
decisive
and
at
the
same
time
such
an
absolutely
chance
meeting
happened
in
the
hay
market
where
he
had
moreover
no
reason
to
go
at
the
very
hour
the
very
minute
of
his
life
when
he
wa
just
in
the
very
mood
and
in
the
very
circumstance
in
which
that
meeting
wa
able
to
exert
the
gravest
and
most
decisive
influence
on
his
whole
destiny
a
though
it
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
him
on
purpose
it
wa
about
nine
o
clock
when
he
crossed
the
hay
market
at
the
table
and
the
barrow
at
the
booth
and
the
shop
all
the
market
people
were
closing
their
establishment
or
clearing
away
and
packing
up
their
ware
and
like
their
customer
were
going
home
rag
picker
and
costermonger
of
all
kind
were
crowding
round
the
tavern
in
the
dirty
and
stinking
courtyard
of
the
hay
market
raskolnikov
particularly
liked
this
place
and
the
neighbouring
alley
when
he
wandered
aimlessly
in
the
street
here
his
rag
did
not
attract
contemptuous
attention
and
one
could
walk
about
in
any
attire
without
scandalising
people
at
the
corner
of
an
alley
a
huckster
and
his
wife
had
two
table
set
out
with
tape
thread
cotton
handkerchief
etc
they
too
had
got
up
to
go
home
but
were
lingering
in
conversation
with
a
friend
who
had
just
come
up
to
them
this
friend
wa
lizaveta
ivanovna
or
a
everyone
called
her
lizaveta
the
younger
sister
of
the
old
pawnbroker
alyona
ivanovna
whom
raskolnikov
had
visited
the
previous
day
to
pawn
his
watch
and
make
his
he
already
knew
all
about
lizaveta
and
she
knew
him
a
little
too
she
wa
a
single
woman
of
about
tall
clumsy
timid
submissive
and
almost
idiotic
she
wa
a
complete
slave
and
went
in
fear
and
trembling
of
her
sister
who
made
her
work
day
and
night
and
even
beat
her
she
wa
standing
with
a
bundle
before
the
huckster
and
his
wife
listening
earnestly
and
doubtfully
they
were
talking
of
something
with
special
warmth
the
moment
raskolnikov
caught
sight
of
her
he
wa
overcome
by
a
strange
sensation
a
it
were
of
intense
astonishment
though
there
wa
nothing
astonishing
about
this
meeting
you
could
make
up
your
mind
for
yourself
lizaveta
ivanovna
the
huckster
wa
saying
aloud
come
round
about
seven
they
will
be
here
said
lizaveta
slowly
and
thoughtfully
a
though
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
upon
my
word
what
a
fright

that

wife

said
lizaveta
still
pondering
and
she
began
slowly
moving
away
raskolnikov
had
just
passed
and
heard
no
more
he
passed
softly
unnoticed
trying
not
to
miss
a
word
his
first
amazement
wa
followed
by
a
thrill
of
horror
like
a
shiver
running
down
his
spine
he
had
learnt
he
had
suddenly
quite
unexpectedly
learnt
that
the
next
day
at
seven
o
clock
lizaveta
the
old
woman
s
sister
and
only
companion
would
be
away
from
home
and
that
therefore
at
seven
o
clock
precisely
the
old
woman
be
left
he
wa
only
a
few
step
from
his
lodging
he
went
in
like
a
man
condemned
to
death
he
thought
of
nothing
and
wa
incapable
of
thinking
but
he
felt
suddenly
in
his
whole
being
that
he
had
no
more
freedom
of
thought
no
will
and
that
everything
wa
suddenly
and
irrevocably
decided
certainly
if
he
had
to
wait
whole
year
for
a
suitable
opportunity
he
could
not
reckon
on
a
more
certain
step
towards
the
success
of
the
plan
than
that
which
had
just
presented
itself
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
out
beforehand
and
with
certainty
with
greater
exactness
and
less
risk
and
without
dangerous
inquiry
and
investigation
that
next
day
at
a
certain
time
an
old
woman
on
whose
life
an
attempt
wa
contemplated
would
be
at
home
and
entirely
alone
chapter
vi
later
on
raskolnikov
happened
to
find
out
why
the
huckster
and
his
wife
had
invited
lizaveta
it
wa
a
very
ordinary
matter
and
there
wa
nothing
exceptional
about
it
a
family
who
had
come
to
the
town
and
been
reduced
to
poverty
were
selling
their
household
good
and
clothes
all
woman
s
thing
a
the
thing
would
have
fetched
little
in
the
market
they
were
looking
for
a
dealer
this
wa
lizaveta
s
business
she
undertook
such
job
and
wa
frequently
employed
a
she
wa
very
honest
and
always
fixed
a
fair
price
and
stuck
to
it
she
spoke
a
a
rule
little
and
a
we
have
said
already
she
wa
very
submissive
and
timid
but
raskolnikov
had
become
superstitious
of
late
the
trace
of
superstition
remained
in
him
long
after
and
were
almost
ineradicable
and
in
all
this
he
wa
always
afterwards
disposed
to
see
something
strange
and
mysterious
a
it
were
the
presence
of
some
peculiar
influence
and
coincidence
in
the
previous
winter
a
student
he
knew
called
pokorev
who
had
left
for
harkov
had
chanced
in
conversation
to
give
him
the
address
of
alyona
ivanovna
the
old
pawnbroker
in
case
he
might
want
to
pawn
anything
for
a
long
while
he
did
not
go
to
her
for
he
had
lesson
and
managed
to
get
along
somehow
six
week
ago
he
had
remembered
the
address
he
had
two
article
that
could
be
pawned
his
father
s
old
silver
watch
and
a
little
gold
ring
with
three
red
stone
a
present
from
his
sister
at
parting
he
decided
to
take
the
ring
when
he
found
the
old
woman
he
had
felt
an
insurmountable
repulsion
for
her
at
the
first
glance
though
he
knew
nothing
special
about
her
he
got
two
rouble
from
her
and
went
into
a
miserable
little
tavern
on
his
way
home
he
asked
for
tea
sat
down
and
sank
into
deep
thought
a
strange
idea
wa
pecking
at
his
brain
like
a
chicken
in
the
egg
and
very
very
much
absorbed
him
almost
beside
him
at
the
next
table
there
wa
sitting
a
student
whom
he
did
not
know
and
had
never
seen
and
with
him
a
young
officer
they
had
played
a
game
of
billiards
and
began
drinking
tea
all
at
once
he
heard
the
student
mention
to
the
officer
the
pawnbroker
alyona
ivanovna
and
give
him
her
address
this
of
itself
seemed
strange
to
raskolnikov
he
had
just
come
from
her
and
here
at
once
he
heard
her
name
of
course
it
wa
a
chance
but
he
could
not
shake
off
a
very
extraordinary
impression
and
here
someone
seemed
to
be
speaking
expressly
for
him
the
student
began
telling
his
friend
various
detail
about
alyona
ivanovna
she
is
he
said
you
can
always
get
money
from
her
she
is
a
rich
a
a
jew
she
can
give
you
five
thousand
rouble
at
a
time
and
she
is
not
above
taking
a
pledge
for
a
rouble
lot
of
our
fellow
have
had
dealing
with
her
but
she
is
an
awful
old
harpy
and
he
began
describing
how
spiteful
and
uncertain
she
wa
how
if
you
were
only
a
day
late
with
your
interest
the
pledge
wa
lost
how
she
gave
a
quarter
of
the
value
of
an
article
and
took
five
and
even
seven
percent
a
month
on
it
and
so
on
the
student
chattered
on
saying
that
she
had
a
sister
lizaveta
whom
the
wretched
little
creature
wa
continually
beating
and
kept
in
complete
bondage
like
a
small
child
though
lizaveta
wa
at
least
six
foot
high
there
s
a
phenomenon
for
you
cried
the
student
and
he
laughed
they
began
talking
about
lizaveta
the
student
spoke
about
her
with
a
peculiar
relish
and
wa
continually
laughing
and
the
officer
listened
with
great
interest
and
asked
him
to
send
lizaveta
to
do
some
mending
for
him
raskolnikov
did
not
miss
a
word
and
learned
everything
about
her
lizaveta
wa
younger
than
the
old
woman
and
wa
her
being
the
child
of
a
different
mother
she
wa
she
worked
day
and
night
for
her
sister
and
besides
doing
the
cooking
and
the
washing
she
did
sewing
and
worked
a
a
charwoman
and
gave
her
sister
all
she
earned
she
did
not
dare
to
accept
an
order
or
job
of
any
kind
without
her
sister
s
permission
the
old
woman
had
already
made
her
will
and
lizaveta
knew
of
it
and
by
this
will
she
would
not
get
a
farthing
nothing
but
the
movable
chair
and
so
on
all
the
money
wa
left
to
a
monastery
in
the
province
of
n
that
prayer
might
be
said
for
her
in
perpetuity
lizaveta
wa
of
lower
rank
than
her
sister
unmarried
and
awfully
uncouth
in
appearance
remarkably
tall
with
long
foot
that
looked
a
if
they
were
bent
outwards
she
always
wore
battered
goatskin
shoe
and
wa
clean
in
her
person
what
the
student
expressed
most
surprise
and
amusement
about
wa
the
fact
that
lizaveta
wa
continually
with
child
but
you
say
she
is
hideous
observed
the
officer
yes
she
is
so
and
look
like
a
soldier
dressed
up
but
you
know
she
is
not
at
all
hideous
she
ha
such
a
face
and
eye
strikingly
so
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
lot
of
people
are
attracted
by
her
she
is
such
a
soft
gentle
creature
ready
to
put
up
with
anything
always
willing
willing
to
do
anything
and
her
smile
is
really
very
you
seem
to
find
her
attractive
yourself
laughed
the
officer
from
her
queerness
no
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
could
kill
that
damned
old
woman
and
make
off
with
her
money
i
assure
you
without
the
faintest
the
student
added
with
warmth
the
officer
laughed
again
while
raskolnikov
shuddered
how
strange
it
wa
listen
i
want
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
the
student
said
hotly
i
wa
joking
of
course
but
look
here
on
one
side
we
have
a
stupid
senseless
worthless
spiteful
ailing
horrid
old
woman
not
simply
useless
but
doing
actual
mischief
who
ha
not
an
idea
what
she
is
living
for
herself
and
who
will
die
in
a
day
or
two
in
any
case
you
understand
you
understand
yes
yes
i
understand
answered
the
officer
watching
his
excited
companion
attentively
well
listen
then
on
the
other
side
fresh
young
life
thrown
away
for
want
of
help
and
by
thousand
on
every
side
a
hundred
thousand
good
deed
could
be
done
and
helped
on
that
old
woman
s
money
which
will
be
buried
in
a
monastery
hundred
thousand
perhaps
might
be
set
on
the
right
path
dozen
of
family
saved
from
destitution
from
ruin
from
vice
from
the
lock
hospital
and
all
with
her
money
kill
her
take
her
money
and
with
the
help
of
it
devote
oneself
to
the
service
of
humanity
and
the
good
of
all
what
do
you
think
would
not
one
tiny
crime
be
wiped
out
by
thousand
of
good
deed
for
one
life
thousand
would
be
saved
from
corruption
and
decay
one
death
and
a
hundred
life
in
exchange
it
s
simple
arithmetic
besides
what
value
ha
the
life
of
that
sickly
stupid
old
woman
in
the
balance
of
existence
no
more
than
the
life
of
a
louse
of
a
less
in
fact
because
the
old
woman
is
doing
harm
she
is
wearing
out
the
life
of
others
the
other
day
she
bit
lizaveta
s
finger
out
of
spite
it
almost
had
to
be
of
course
she
doe
not
deserve
to
live
remarked
the
officer
but
there
it
is
it
s
oh
well
brother
but
we
have
to
correct
and
direct
nature
and
but
for
that
we
should
drown
in
an
ocean
of
prejudice
but
for
that
there
would
never
have
been
a
single
great
man
they
talk
of
duty
conscience
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
against
duty
and
conscience
but
the
point
is
what
do
we
mean
by
them
stay
i
have
another
question
to
ask
you
listen
no
you
stay
i
ll
ask
you
a
question
listen
well
you
are
talking
and
speechifying
away
but
tell
me
would
you
kill
the
old
woman
of
course
not
i
wa
only
arguing
the
justice
of
it
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
i
think
if
you
would
not
do
it
yourself
there
s
no
justice
about
it
let
u
have
another
raskolnikov
wa
violently
agitated
of
course
it
wa
all
ordinary
youthful
talk
and
thought
such
a
he
had
often
heard
before
in
different
form
and
on
different
theme
but
why
had
he
happened
to
hear
such
a
discussion
and
such
idea
at
the
very
moment
when
his
own
brain
wa
just
conceiving
very
same
and
why
just
at
the
moment
when
he
had
brought
away
the
embryo
of
his
idea
from
the
old
woman
had
he
dropped
at
once
upon
a
conversation
about
her
this
coincidence
always
seemed
strange
to
him
this
trivial
talk
in
a
tavern
had
an
immense
influence
on
him
in
his
later
action
a
though
there
had
really
been
in
it
something
preordained
some
guiding
hint
on
returning
from
the
hay
market
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
and
sat
for
a
whole
hour
without
stirring
meanwhile
it
got
dark
he
had
no
candle
and
indeed
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
light
up
he
could
never
recollect
whether
he
had
been
thinking
about
anything
at
that
time
at
last
he
wa
conscious
of
his
former
fever
and
shivering
and
he
realised
with
relief
that
he
could
lie
down
on
the
sofa
soon
heavy
leaden
sleep
came
over
him
a
it
were
crushing
him
he
slept
an
extraordinarily
long
time
and
without
dreaming
nastasya
coming
into
his
room
at
ten
o
clock
the
next
morning
had
difficulty
in
rousing
him
she
brought
him
in
tea
and
bread
the
tea
wa
again
the
second
brew
and
again
in
her
own
my
goodness
how
he
sleep
she
cried
indignantly
and
he
is
always
he
got
up
with
an
effort
his
head
ached
he
stood
up
took
a
turn
in
his
garret
and
sank
back
on
the
sofa
again
going
to
sleep
again
cried
nastasya
are
you
ill
eh
he
made
no
reply
do
you
want
some
tea
afterwards
he
said
with
an
effort
closing
his
eye
again
and
turning
to
the
wall
nastasya
stood
over
him
perhaps
he
really
is
ill
she
said
turned
and
went
out
she
came
in
again
at
two
o
clock
with
soup
he
wa
lying
a
before
the
tea
stood
untouched
nastasya
felt
positively
offended
and
began
wrathfully
rousing
him
why
are
you
lying
like
a
log
she
shouted
looking
at
him
with
repulsion
he
got
up
and
sat
down
again
but
said
nothing
and
stared
at
the
floor
are
you
ill
or
not
asked
nastasya
and
again
received
no
answer
you
d
better
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
she
said
after
a
pause
will
you
eat
it
or
not
afterwards
he
said
weakly
you
can
and
he
motioned
her
out
she
remained
a
little
longer
looked
at
him
with
compassion
and
went
out
a
few
minute
afterwards
he
raised
his
eye
and
looked
for
a
long
while
at
the
tea
and
the
soup
then
he
took
the
bread
took
up
a
spoon
and
began
to
eat
he
ate
a
little
three
or
four
spoonful
without
appetite
a
it
were
mechanically
his
head
ached
less
after
his
meal
he
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
again
but
now
he
could
not
sleep
he
lay
without
stirring
with
his
face
in
the
pillow
he
wa
haunted
by
and
such
strange
in
one
that
kept
recurring
he
fancied
that
he
wa
in
africa
in
egypt
in
some
sort
of
oasis
the
caravan
wa
resting
the
camel
were
peacefully
lying
down
the
palm
stood
all
around
in
a
complete
circle
all
the
party
were
at
dinner
but
he
wa
drinking
water
from
a
spring
which
flowed
gurgling
close
by
and
it
wa
so
cool
it
wa
wonderful
wonderful
blue
cold
water
running
among
the
stone
and
over
the
clean
sand
which
glistened
here
and
there
like
gold
suddenly
he
heard
a
clock
strike
he
started
roused
himself
raised
his
head
looked
out
of
the
window
and
seeing
how
late
it
wa
suddenly
jumped
up
wide
awake
a
though
someone
had
pulled
him
off
the
sofa
he
crept
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
stealthily
opened
it
and
began
listening
on
the
staircase
his
heart
beat
terribly
but
all
wa
quiet
on
the
stair
a
if
everyone
wa
asleep
it
seemed
to
him
strange
and
monstrous
that
he
could
have
slept
in
such
forgetfulness
from
the
previous
day
and
had
done
nothing
had
prepared
nothing
yet
and
meanwhile
perhaps
it
had
struck
six
and
his
drowsiness
and
stupefaction
were
followed
by
an
extraordinary
feverish
a
it
were
distracted
haste
but
the
preparation
to
be
made
were
few
he
concentrated
all
his
energy
on
thinking
of
everything
and
forgetting
nothing
and
his
heart
kept
beating
and
thumping
so
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
first
he
had
to
make
a
noose
and
sew
it
into
his
overcoat
a
work
of
a
moment
he
rummaged
under
his
pillow
and
picked
out
amongst
the
linen
stuffed
away
under
it
a
worn
out
old
unwashed
shirt
from
it
rag
he
tore
a
long
strip
a
couple
of
inch
wide
and
about
sixteen
inch
long
he
folded
this
strip
in
two
took
off
his
wide
strong
summer
overcoat
of
some
stout
cotton
material
his
only
outer
garment
and
began
sewing
the
two
end
of
the
rag
on
the
inside
under
the
left
armhole
his
hand
shook
a
he
sewed
but
he
did
it
successfully
so
that
nothing
showed
outside
when
he
put
the
coat
on
again
the
needle
and
thread
he
had
got
ready
long
before
and
they
lay
on
his
table
in
a
piece
of
paper
a
for
the
noose
it
wa
a
very
ingenious
device
of
his
own
the
noose
wa
intended
for
the
axe
it
wa
impossible
for
him
to
carry
the
axe
through
the
street
in
his
hand
and
if
hidden
under
his
coat
he
would
still
have
had
to
support
it
with
his
hand
which
would
have
been
noticeable
now
he
had
only
to
put
the
head
of
the
axe
in
the
noose
and
it
would
hang
quietly
under
his
arm
on
the
inside
putting
his
hand
in
his
coat
pocket
he
could
hold
the
end
of
the
handle
all
the
way
so
that
it
did
not
swing
and
a
the
coat
wa
very
full
a
regular
sack
in
fact
it
could
not
be
seen
from
outside
that
he
wa
holding
something
with
the
hand
that
wa
in
the
pocket
this
noose
too
he
had
designed
a
fortnight
before
when
he
had
finished
with
this
he
thrust
his
hand
into
a
little
opening
between
his
sofa
and
the
floor
fumbled
in
the
left
corner
and
drew
out
the
which
he
had
got
ready
long
before
and
hidden
there
this
pledge
wa
however
only
a
smoothly
planed
piece
of
wood
the
size
and
thickness
of
a
silver
cigarette
case
he
picked
up
this
piece
of
wood
in
one
of
his
wandering
in
a
courtyard
where
there
wa
some
sort
of
a
workshop
afterwards
he
had
added
to
the
wood
a
thin
smooth
piece
of
iron
which
he
had
also
picked
up
at
the
same
time
in
the
street
putting
the
iron
which
wa
a
little
the
smaller
on
the
piece
of
wood
he
fastened
them
very
firmly
crossing
and
the
thread
round
them
then
wrapped
them
carefully
and
daintily
in
clean
white
paper
and
tied
up
the
parcel
so
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
untie
it
this
wa
in
order
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
old
woman
for
a
time
while
she
wa
trying
to
undo
the
knot
and
so
to
gain
a
moment
the
iron
strip
wa
added
to
give
weight
so
that
the
woman
might
not
guess
the
first
minute
that
the
thing
wa
made
of
wood
all
this
had
been
stored
by
him
beforehand
under
the
sofa
he
had
only
just
got
the
pledge
out
when
he
heard
someone
suddenly
about
in
the
yard
it
struck
six
long
long
ago
my
god
he
rushed
to
the
door
listened
caught
up
his
hat
and
began
to
descend
his
thirteen
step
cautiously
noiselessly
like
a
cat
he
had
still
the
most
important
thing
to
do
to
steal
the
axe
from
the
kitchen
that
the
deed
must
be
done
with
an
axe
he
had
decided
long
ago
he
had
also
a
pocket
but
he
could
not
rely
on
the
knife
and
still
less
on
his
own
strength
and
so
resolved
finally
on
the
axe
we
may
note
in
passing
one
peculiarity
in
regard
to
all
the
final
resolution
taken
by
him
in
the
matter
they
had
one
strange
characteristic
the
more
final
they
were
the
more
hideous
and
the
more
absurd
they
at
once
became
in
his
eye
in
spite
of
all
his
agonising
inward
struggle
he
never
for
a
single
instant
all
that
time
could
believe
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
plan
and
indeed
if
it
had
ever
happened
that
everything
to
the
least
point
could
have
been
considered
and
finally
settled
and
no
uncertainty
of
any
kind
had
remained
he
would
it
seems
have
renounced
it
all
a
something
absurd
monstrous
and
impossible
but
a
whole
mass
of
unsettled
point
and
uncertainty
remained
a
for
getting
the
axe
that
trifling
business
cost
him
no
anxiety
for
nothing
could
be
easier
nastasya
wa
continually
out
of
the
house
especially
in
the
evening
she
would
run
in
to
the
neighbour
or
to
a
shop
and
always
left
the
door
ajar
it
wa
the
one
thing
the
landlady
wa
always
scolding
her
about
and
so
when
the
time
came
he
would
only
have
to
go
quietly
into
the
kitchen
and
to
take
the
axe
and
an
hour
later
when
everything
wa
over
go
in
and
put
it
back
again
but
these
were
doubtful
point
supposing
he
returned
an
hour
later
to
put
it
back
and
nastasya
had
come
back
and
wa
on
the
spot
he
would
of
course
have
to
go
by
and
wait
till
she
went
out
again
but
supposing
she
were
in
the
meantime
to
miss
the
axe
look
for
it
make
an
outcry
that
would
mean
suspicion
or
at
least
ground
for
suspicion
but
those
were
all
trifle
which
he
had
not
even
begun
to
consider
and
indeed
he
had
no
time
he
wa
thinking
of
the
chief
point
and
put
off
trifling
detail
until
could
believe
in
it
but
that
seemed
utterly
unattainable
so
it
seemed
to
himself
at
least
he
could
not
imagine
for
instance
that
he
would
sometime
leave
off
thinking
get
up
and
simply
go
there
even
his
late
experiment
his
visit
with
the
object
of
a
final
survey
of
the
place
wa
simply
an
attempt
at
an
experiment
far
from
being
the
real
thing
a
though
one
should
say
come
let
u
go
and
try
it
why
dream
about
it
and
at
once
he
had
broken
down
and
had
run
away
cursing
in
a
frenzy
with
himself
meanwhile
it
would
seem
a
regard
the
moral
question
that
his
analysis
wa
complete
his
casuistry
had
become
keen
a
a
razor
and
he
could
not
find
rational
objection
in
himself
but
in
the
last
resort
he
simply
ceased
to
believe
in
himself
and
doggedly
slavishly
sought
argument
in
all
direction
fumbling
for
them
a
though
someone
were
forcing
and
drawing
him
to
it
at
first
long
before
indeed
he
had
been
much
occupied
with
one
question
why
almost
all
crime
are
so
badly
concealed
and
so
easily
detected
and
why
almost
all
criminal
leave
such
obvious
trace
he
had
come
gradually
to
many
different
and
curious
conclusion
and
in
his
opinion
the
chief
reason
lay
not
so
much
in
the
material
impossibility
of
concealing
the
crime
a
in
the
criminal
himself
almost
every
criminal
is
subject
to
a
failure
of
will
and
reasoning
power
by
a
childish
and
phenomenal
heedlessness
at
the
very
instant
when
prudence
and
caution
are
most
essential
it
wa
his
conviction
that
this
eclipse
of
reason
and
failure
of
will
power
attacked
a
man
like
a
disease
developed
gradually
and
reached
it
highest
point
just
before
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
continued
with
equal
violence
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
and
for
longer
or
shorter
time
after
according
to
the
individual
case
and
then
passed
off
like
any
other
disease
the
question
whether
the
disease
give
rise
to
the
crime
or
whether
the
crime
from
it
own
peculiar
nature
is
always
accompanied
by
something
of
the
nature
of
disease
he
did
not
yet
feel
able
to
decide
when
he
reached
these
conclusion
he
decided
that
in
his
own
case
there
could
not
be
such
a
morbid
reaction
that
his
reason
and
will
would
remain
unimpaired
at
the
time
of
carrying
out
his
design
for
the
simple
reason
that
his
design
wa
not
a
crime
we
will
omit
all
the
process
by
mean
of
which
he
arrived
at
this
last
conclusion
we
have
run
too
far
ahead
already
we
may
add
only
that
the
practical
purely
material
difficulty
of
the
affair
occupied
a
secondary
position
in
his
mind
one
ha
but
to
keep
all
one
s
and
reason
to
deal
with
them
and
they
will
all
be
overcome
at
the
time
when
once
one
ha
familiarised
oneself
with
the
minutest
detail
of
the
business
but
this
preparation
had
never
been
begun
his
final
decision
were
what
he
came
to
trust
least
and
when
the
hour
struck
it
all
came
to
pas
quite
differently
a
it
were
accidentally
and
unexpectedly
one
trifling
circumstance
upset
his
calculation
before
he
had
even
left
the
staircase
when
he
reached
the
landlady
s
kitchen
the
door
of
which
wa
open
a
usual
he
glanced
cautiously
in
to
see
whether
in
nastasya
s
absence
the
landlady
herself
wa
there
or
if
not
whether
the
door
to
her
own
room
wa
closed
so
that
she
might
not
peep
out
when
he
went
in
for
the
axe
but
what
wa
his
amazement
when
he
suddenly
saw
that
nastasya
wa
not
only
at
home
in
the
kitchen
but
wa
occupied
there
taking
linen
out
of
a
basket
and
hanging
it
on
a
line
seeing
him
she
left
off
hanging
the
clothes
turned
to
him
and
stared
at
him
all
the
time
he
wa
passing
he
turned
away
his
eye
and
walked
past
a
though
he
noticed
nothing
but
it
wa
the
end
of
everything
he
had
not
the
axe
he
wa
overwhelmed
what
made
me
think
he
reflected
a
he
went
under
the
gateway
what
made
me
think
that
she
would
be
sure
not
to
be
at
home
at
that
moment
why
why
why
did
i
assume
this
so
certainly
he
wa
crushed
and
even
humiliated
he
could
have
laughed
at
himself
in
his
anger
a
dull
animal
rage
boiled
within
him
he
stood
hesitating
in
the
gateway
to
go
into
the
street
to
go
a
walk
for
appearance
sake
wa
revolting
to
go
back
to
his
room
even
more
revolting
and
what
a
chance
i
have
lost
for
ever
he
muttered
standing
aimlessly
in
the
gateway
just
opposite
the
porter
s
little
dark
room
which
wa
also
open
suddenly
he
started
from
the
porter
s
room
two
pace
away
from
him
something
shining
under
the
bench
to
the
right
caught
his
eye
he
looked
about
him
nobody
he
approached
the
room
on
tiptoe
went
down
two
step
into
it
and
in
a
faint
voice
called
the
porter
yes
not
at
home
somewhere
near
though
in
the
yard
for
the
door
is
wide
he
dashed
to
the
axe
it
wa
an
axe
and
pulled
it
out
from
under
the
bench
where
it
lay
between
two
chunk
of
wood
at
once
before
going
out
he
made
it
fast
in
the
noose
he
thrust
both
hand
into
his
pocket
and
went
out
of
the
room
no
one
had
noticed
him
when
reason
fails
the
devil
help
he
thought
with
a
strange
grin
this
chance
raised
his
spirit
extraordinarily
he
walked
along
quietly
and
sedately
without
hurry
to
avoid
awakening
suspicion
he
scarcely
looked
at
the
tried
to
escape
looking
at
their
face
at
all
and
to
be
a
little
noticeable
a
possible
suddenly
he
thought
of
his
hat
good
heaven
i
had
the
money
the
day
before
yesterday
and
did
not
get
a
cap
to
wear
instead
a
curse
rose
from
the
bottom
of
his
soul
glancing
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
into
a
shop
he
saw
by
a
clock
on
the
wall
that
it
wa
ten
minute
past
seven
he
had
to
make
haste
and
at
the
same
time
to
go
someway
round
so
a
to
approach
the
house
from
the
other
side
when
he
had
happened
to
imagine
all
this
beforehand
he
had
sometimes
thought
that
he
would
be
very
much
afraid
but
he
wa
not
very
much
afraid
now
wa
not
afraid
at
all
indeed
his
mind
wa
even
occupied
by
irrelevant
matter
but
by
nothing
for
long
a
he
passed
the
yusupov
garden
he
wa
deeply
absorbed
in
considering
the
building
of
great
fountain
and
of
their
refreshing
effect
on
the
atmosphere
in
all
the
square
by
degree
he
passed
to
the
conviction
that
if
the
summer
garden
were
extended
to
the
field
of
mar
and
perhaps
joined
to
the
garden
of
the
mihailovsky
palace
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
and
a
great
benefit
to
the
town
then
he
wa
interested
by
the
question
why
in
all
great
town
men
are
not
simply
driven
by
necessity
but
in
some
peculiar
way
inclined
to
live
in
those
part
of
the
town
where
there
are
no
garden
nor
fountain
where
there
is
most
dirt
and
smell
and
all
sort
of
nastiness
then
his
own
walk
through
the
hay
market
came
back
to
his
mind
and
for
a
moment
he
waked
up
to
reality
what
nonsense
he
thought
better
think
of
nothing
at
all
so
probably
men
led
to
execution
clutch
mentally
at
every
object
that
meet
them
on
the
way
flashed
through
his
mind
but
simply
flashed
like
lightning
he
made
haste
to
dismiss
this
thought
and
by
now
he
wa
near
here
wa
the
house
here
wa
the
gate
suddenly
a
clock
somewhere
struck
once
what
can
it
be
seven
impossible
it
must
be
fast
luckily
for
him
everything
went
well
again
at
the
gate
at
that
very
moment
a
though
expressly
for
his
benefit
a
huge
waggon
of
hay
had
just
driven
in
at
the
gate
completely
screening
him
a
he
passed
under
the
gateway
and
the
waggon
had
scarcely
had
time
to
drive
through
into
the
yard
before
he
had
slipped
in
a
flash
to
the
right
on
the
other
side
of
the
waggon
he
could
hear
shouting
and
quarrelling
but
no
one
noticed
him
and
no
one
met
him
many
window
looking
into
that
huge
quadrangular
yard
were
open
at
that
moment
but
he
did
not
raise
his
head
he
had
not
the
strength
to
the
staircase
leading
to
the
old
woman
s
room
wa
close
by
just
on
the
right
of
the
gateway
he
wa
already
on
the
stair
drawing
a
breath
pressing
his
hand
against
his
throbbing
heart
and
once
more
feeling
for
the
axe
and
setting
it
straight
he
began
softly
and
cautiously
ascending
the
stair
listening
every
minute
but
the
stair
too
were
quite
deserted
all
the
door
were
shut
he
met
no
one
one
flat
indeed
on
the
first
floor
wa
wide
open
and
painter
were
at
work
in
it
but
they
did
not
glance
at
him
he
stood
still
thought
a
minute
and
went
on
of
course
it
would
be
better
if
they
had
not
been
here
but
it
s
two
storey
above
and
there
wa
the
fourth
storey
here
wa
the
door
here
wa
the
flat
opposite
the
empty
one
the
flat
underneath
the
old
woman
s
wa
apparently
empty
also
the
visiting
card
nailed
on
the
door
had
been
torn
off
they
had
gone
away
he
wa
out
of
breath
for
one
instant
the
thought
floated
through
his
mind
shall
i
go
back
but
he
made
no
answer
and
began
listening
at
the
old
woman
s
door
a
dead
silence
then
he
listened
again
on
the
staircase
listened
long
and
intently
then
looked
about
him
for
the
last
time
pulled
himself
together
drew
himself
up
and
once
more
tried
the
axe
in
the
noose
am
i
very
pale
he
wondered
am
i
not
evidently
agitated
she
is
mistrustful
had
i
better
wait
a
little
longer
till
my
heart
leaf
off
thumping
but
his
heart
did
not
leave
off
on
the
contrary
a
though
to
spite
him
it
throbbed
more
and
more
violently
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
slowly
put
out
his
hand
to
the
bell
and
rang
half
a
minute
later
he
rang
again
more
loudly
no
answer
to
go
on
ringing
wa
useless
and
out
of
place
the
old
woman
wa
of
course
at
home
but
she
wa
suspicious
and
alone
he
had
some
knowledge
of
her
habit
and
once
more
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
either
his
sens
were
peculiarly
keen
which
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
or
the
sound
wa
really
very
distinct
anyway
he
suddenly
heard
something
like
the
cautious
touch
of
a
hand
on
the
lock
and
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
at
the
very
door
someone
wa
standing
stealthily
close
to
the
lock
and
just
a
he
wa
doing
on
the
outside
wa
secretly
listening
within
and
seemed
to
have
her
ear
to
the
door
he
moved
a
little
on
purpose
and
muttered
something
aloud
that
he
might
not
have
the
appearance
of
hiding
then
rang
a
third
time
but
quietly
soberly
and
without
impatience
recalling
it
afterwards
that
moment
stood
out
in
his
mind
vividly
distinctly
for
ever
he
could
not
make
out
how
he
had
had
such
cunning
for
his
mind
wa
a
it
were
clouded
at
moment
and
he
wa
almost
unconscious
of
his
body
an
instant
later
he
heard
the
latch
unfastened
chapter
vii
the
door
wa
a
before
opened
a
tiny
crack
and
again
two
sharp
and
suspicious
eye
stared
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
then
raskolnikov
lost
his
head
and
nearly
made
a
great
mistake
fearing
the
old
woman
would
be
frightened
by
their
being
alone
and
not
hoping
that
the
sight
of
him
would
disarm
her
suspicion
he
took
hold
of
the
door
and
drew
it
towards
him
to
prevent
the
old
woman
from
attempting
to
shut
it
again
seeing
this
she
did
not
pull
the
door
back
but
she
did
not
let
go
the
handle
so
that
he
almost
dragged
her
out
with
it
on
to
the
stair
seeing
that
she
wa
standing
in
the
doorway
not
allowing
him
to
pas
he
advanced
straight
upon
her
she
stepped
back
in
alarm
tried
to
say
something
but
seemed
unable
to
speak
and
stared
with
open
eye
at
him
good
evening
alyona
ivanovna
he
began
trying
to
speak
easily
but
his
voice
would
not
obey
him
it
broke
and
shook
i
have
come
i
have
brought
something
but
we
d
better
come
in
to
the
light
and
leaving
her
he
passed
straight
into
the
room
uninvited
the
old
woman
ran
after
him
her
tongue
wa
unloosed
good
heaven
what
it
is
who
is
it
what
do
you
want
why
alyona
ivanovna
you
know
me
raskolnikov
here
i
brought
you
the
pledge
i
promised
the
other
day
and
he
held
out
the
pledge
the
old
woman
glanced
for
a
moment
at
the
pledge
but
at
once
stared
in
the
eye
of
her
uninvited
visitor
she
looked
intently
maliciously
and
mistrustfully
a
minute
passed
he
even
fancied
something
like
a
sneer
in
her
eye
a
though
she
had
already
guessed
everything
he
felt
that
he
wa
losing
his
head
that
he
wa
almost
frightened
so
frightened
that
if
she
were
to
look
like
that
and
not
say
a
word
for
another
half
minute
he
thought
he
would
have
run
away
from
her
why
do
you
look
at
me
a
though
you
did
not
know
me
he
said
suddenly
also
with
malice
take
it
if
you
like
if
not
i
ll
go
elsewhere
i
am
in
a
he
had
not
even
thought
of
saying
this
but
it
wa
suddenly
said
of
itself
the
old
woman
recovered
herself
and
her
visitor
s
resolute
tone
evidently
restored
her
confidence
but
why
my
good
sir
all
of
a
minute
what
is
it
she
asked
looking
at
the
pledge
the
silver
cigarette
case
i
spoke
of
it
last
time
you
she
held
out
her
hand
but
how
pale
you
are
to
be
sure
and
your
hand
are
trembling
too
have
you
been
bathing
or
what
fever
he
answered
abruptly
you
can
t
help
getting
pale
if
you
ve
nothing
to
eat
he
added
with
difficulty
articulating
the
word
his
strength
wa
failing
him
again
but
his
answer
sounded
like
the
truth
the
old
woman
took
the
pledge
what
is
it
she
asked
once
more
scanning
raskolnikov
intently
and
weighing
the
pledge
in
her
hand
a
thing
cigarette
case
silver
look
at
it
doe
not
seem
somehow
like
silver
how
he
ha
wrapped
it
up
trying
to
untie
the
string
and
turning
to
the
window
to
the
light
all
her
window
were
shut
in
spite
of
the
stifling
heat
she
left
him
altogether
for
some
second
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
freed
the
axe
from
the
noose
but
did
not
yet
take
it
out
altogether
simply
holding
it
in
his
right
hand
under
the
coat
his
hand
were
fearfully
weak
he
felt
them
every
moment
growing
more
numb
and
more
wooden
he
wa
afraid
he
would
let
the
axe
slip
and
fall
a
sudden
giddiness
came
over
him
but
what
ha
he
tied
it
up
like
this
for
the
old
woman
cried
with
vexation
and
moved
towards
him
he
had
not
a
minute
more
to
lose
he
pulled
the
axe
quite
out
swung
it
with
both
arm
scarcely
conscious
of
himself
and
almost
without
effort
almost
mechanically
brought
the
blunt
side
down
on
her
head
he
seemed
not
to
use
his
own
strength
in
this
but
a
soon
a
he
had
once
brought
the
axe
down
his
strength
returned
to
him
the
old
woman
wa
a
always
bareheaded
her
thin
light
hair
streaked
with
grey
thickly
smeared
with
grease
wa
plaited
in
a
rat
s
tail
and
fastened
by
a
broken
horn
comb
which
stood
out
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
a
she
wa
so
short
the
blow
fell
on
the
very
top
of
her
skull
she
cried
out
but
very
faintly
and
suddenly
sank
all
of
a
heap
on
the
floor
raising
her
hand
to
her
head
in
one
hand
she
still
held
the
then
he
dealt
her
another
and
another
blow
with
the
blunt
side
and
on
the
same
spot
the
blood
gushed
a
from
an
overturned
glass
the
body
fell
back
he
stepped
back
let
it
fall
and
at
once
bent
over
her
face
she
wa
dead
her
eye
seemed
to
be
starting
out
of
their
socket
the
brow
and
the
whole
face
were
drawn
and
contorted
convulsively
he
laid
the
axe
on
the
ground
near
the
dead
body
and
felt
at
once
in
her
pocket
trying
to
avoid
the
streaming
body
the
same
pocket
from
which
she
had
taken
the
key
on
his
last
visit
he
wa
in
full
possession
of
his
faculty
free
from
confusion
or
giddiness
but
his
hand
were
still
trembling
he
remembered
afterwards
that
he
had
been
particularly
collected
and
careful
trying
all
the
time
not
to
get
smeared
with
blood
he
pulled
out
the
key
at
once
they
were
all
a
before
in
one
bunch
on
a
steel
ring
he
ran
at
once
into
the
bedroom
with
them
it
wa
a
very
small
room
with
a
whole
shrine
of
holy
image
against
the
other
wall
stood
a
big
bed
very
clean
and
covered
with
a
silk
patchwork
wadded
quilt
against
a
third
wall
wa
a
chest
of
drawer
strange
to
say
so
soon
a
he
began
to
fit
the
key
into
the
chest
so
soon
a
he
heard
their
jingling
a
convulsive
shudder
passed
over
him
he
suddenly
felt
tempted
again
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
away
but
that
wa
only
for
an
instant
it
wa
too
late
to
go
back
he
positively
smiled
at
himself
when
suddenly
another
terrifying
idea
occurred
to
his
mind
he
suddenly
fancied
that
the
old
woman
might
be
still
alive
and
might
recover
her
sens
leaving
the
key
in
the
chest
he
ran
back
to
the
body
snatched
up
the
axe
and
lifted
it
once
more
over
the
old
woman
but
did
not
bring
it
down
there
wa
no
doubt
that
she
wa
dead
bending
down
and
examining
her
again
more
closely
he
saw
clearly
that
the
skull
wa
broken
and
even
battered
in
on
one
side
he
wa
about
to
feel
it
with
his
finger
but
drew
back
his
hand
and
indeed
it
wa
evident
without
that
meanwhile
there
wa
a
perfect
pool
of
blood
all
at
once
he
noticed
a
string
on
her
neck
he
tugged
at
it
but
the
string
wa
strong
and
did
not
snap
and
besides
it
wa
soaked
with
blood
he
tried
to
pull
it
out
from
the
front
of
the
dress
but
something
held
it
and
prevented
it
coming
in
his
impatience
he
raised
the
axe
again
to
cut
the
string
from
above
on
the
body
but
did
not
dare
and
with
difficulty
smearing
his
hand
and
the
axe
in
the
blood
after
two
minute
hurried
effort
he
cut
the
string
and
took
it
off
without
touching
the
body
with
the
axe
he
wa
not
mistaken
it
wa
a
purse
on
the
string
were
two
cross
one
of
cyprus
wood
and
one
of
copper
and
an
image
in
silver
filigree
and
with
them
a
small
greasy
chamois
leather
purse
with
a
steel
rim
and
ring
the
purse
wa
stuffed
very
full
raskolnikov
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
without
looking
at
it
flung
the
cross
on
the
old
woman
s
body
and
rushed
back
into
the
bedroom
this
time
taking
the
axe
with
him
he
wa
in
terrible
haste
he
snatched
the
key
and
began
trying
them
again
but
he
wa
unsuccessful
they
would
not
fit
in
the
lock
it
wa
not
so
much
that
his
hand
were
shaking
but
that
he
kept
making
mistake
though
he
saw
for
instance
that
a
key
wa
not
the
right
one
and
would
not
fit
still
he
tried
to
put
it
in
suddenly
he
remembered
and
realised
that
the
big
key
with
the
deep
notch
which
wa
hanging
there
with
the
small
key
could
not
possibly
belong
to
the
chest
of
drawer
on
his
last
visit
this
had
struck
him
but
to
some
strong
box
and
that
everything
perhaps
wa
hidden
in
that
box
he
left
the
chest
of
drawer
and
at
once
felt
under
the
bedstead
knowing
that
old
woman
usually
keep
box
under
their
bed
and
so
it
wa
there
wa
a
box
under
the
bed
at
least
a
yard
in
length
with
an
arched
lid
covered
with
red
leather
and
studded
with
steel
nail
the
notched
key
fitted
at
once
and
unlocked
it
at
the
top
under
a
white
sheet
wa
a
coat
of
red
brocade
lined
with
hareskin
under
it
wa
a
silk
dress
then
a
shawl
and
it
seemed
a
though
there
wa
nothing
below
but
clothes
the
first
thing
he
did
wa
to
wipe
his
hand
on
the
red
brocade
it
s
red
and
on
red
blood
will
be
less
noticeable
the
thought
passed
through
his
mind
then
he
suddenly
came
to
himself
good
god
am
i
going
out
of
my
sens
he
thought
with
terror
but
no
sooner
did
he
touch
the
clothes
than
a
gold
watch
slipped
from
under
the
fur
coat
he
made
haste
to
turn
them
all
over
there
turned
out
to
be
various
article
made
of
gold
among
the
clothes
probably
all
pledge
unredeemed
or
waiting
to
be
redeemed
bracelet
chain
pin
and
such
thing
some
were
in
case
others
simply
wrapped
in
newspaper
carefully
and
exactly
folded
and
tied
round
with
tape
without
any
delay
he
began
filling
up
the
pocket
of
his
trouser
and
overcoat
without
examining
or
undoing
the
parcel
and
case
but
he
had
not
time
to
take
many
he
suddenly
heard
step
in
the
room
where
the
old
woman
lay
he
stopped
short
and
wa
still
a
death
but
all
wa
quiet
so
it
must
have
been
his
fancy
all
at
once
he
heard
distinctly
a
faint
cry
a
though
someone
had
uttered
a
low
broken
moan
then
again
dead
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
he
sat
squatting
on
his
heel
by
the
box
and
waited
holding
his
breath
suddenly
he
jumped
up
seized
the
axe
and
ran
out
of
the
bedroom
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
lizaveta
with
a
big
bundle
in
her
arm
she
wa
gazing
in
stupefaction
at
her
murdered
sister
white
a
a
sheet
and
seeming
not
to
have
the
strength
to
cry
out
seeing
him
run
out
of
the
bedroom
she
began
faintly
quivering
all
over
like
a
leaf
a
shudder
ran
down
her
face
she
lifted
her
hand
opened
her
mouth
but
still
did
not
scream
she
began
slowly
backing
away
from
him
into
the
corner
staring
intently
persistently
at
him
but
still
uttered
no
sound
a
though
she
could
not
get
breath
to
scream
he
rushed
at
her
with
the
axe
her
mouth
twitched
piteously
a
one
see
baby
mouth
when
they
begin
to
be
frightened
stare
intently
at
what
frightens
them
and
are
on
the
point
of
screaming
and
this
hapless
lizaveta
wa
so
simple
and
had
been
so
thoroughly
crushed
and
scared
that
she
did
not
even
raise
a
hand
to
guard
her
face
though
that
wa
the
most
necessary
and
natural
action
at
the
moment
for
the
axe
wa
raised
over
her
face
she
only
put
up
her
empty
left
hand
but
not
to
her
face
slowly
holding
it
out
before
her
a
though
motioning
him
away
the
axe
fell
with
the
sharp
edge
just
on
the
skull
and
split
at
one
blow
all
the
top
of
the
head
she
fell
heavily
at
once
raskolnikov
completely
lost
his
head
snatching
up
her
bundle
dropped
it
again
and
ran
into
the
entry
fear
gained
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
especially
after
this
second
quite
unexpected
murder
he
longed
to
run
away
from
the
place
a
fast
a
possible
and
if
at
that
moment
he
had
been
capable
of
seeing
and
reasoning
more
correctly
if
he
had
been
able
to
realise
all
the
difficulty
of
his
position
the
hopelessness
the
hideousness
and
the
absurdity
of
it
if
he
could
have
understood
how
many
obstacle
and
perhaps
crime
he
had
still
to
overcome
or
to
commit
to
get
out
of
that
place
and
to
make
his
way
home
it
is
very
possible
that
he
would
have
flung
up
everything
and
would
have
gone
to
give
himself
up
and
not
from
fear
but
from
simple
horror
and
loathing
of
what
he
had
done
the
feeling
of
loathing
especially
surged
up
within
him
and
grew
stronger
every
minute
he
would
not
now
have
gone
to
the
box
or
even
into
the
room
for
anything
in
the
world
but
a
sort
of
blankness
even
dreaminess
had
begun
by
degree
to
take
possession
of
him
at
moment
he
forgot
himself
or
rather
forgot
what
wa
of
importance
and
caught
at
trifle
glancing
however
into
the
kitchen
and
seeing
a
bucket
half
full
of
water
on
a
bench
he
bethought
him
of
washing
his
hand
and
the
axe
his
hand
were
sticky
with
blood
he
dropped
the
axe
with
the
blade
in
the
water
snatched
a
piece
of
soap
that
lay
in
a
broken
saucer
on
the
window
and
began
washing
his
hand
in
the
bucket
when
they
were
clean
he
took
out
the
axe
washed
the
blade
and
spent
a
long
time
about
three
minute
washing
the
wood
where
there
were
spot
of
blood
rubbing
them
with
soap
then
he
wiped
it
all
with
some
linen
that
wa
hanging
to
dry
on
a
line
in
the
kitchen
and
then
he
wa
a
long
while
attentively
examining
the
axe
at
the
window
there
wa
no
trace
left
on
it
only
the
wood
wa
still
damp
he
carefully
hung
the
axe
in
the
noose
under
his
coat
then
a
far
a
wa
possible
in
the
dim
light
in
the
kitchen
he
looked
over
his
overcoat
his
trouser
and
his
boot
at
the
first
glance
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
stain
on
the
boot
he
wetted
the
rag
and
rubbed
the
boot
but
he
knew
he
wa
not
looking
thoroughly
that
there
might
be
something
quite
noticeable
that
he
wa
overlooking
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
lost
in
thought
dark
agonising
idea
rose
in
his
mind
the
idea
that
he
wa
mad
and
that
at
that
moment
he
wa
incapable
of
reasoning
of
protecting
himself
that
he
ought
perhaps
to
be
doing
something
utterly
different
from
what
he
wa
now
doing
good
god
he
muttered
i
must
fly
fly
and
he
rushed
into
the
entry
but
here
a
shock
of
terror
awaited
him
such
a
he
had
never
known
before
he
stood
and
gazed
and
could
not
believe
his
eye
the
door
the
outer
door
from
the
stair
at
which
he
had
not
long
before
waited
and
rung
wa
standing
unfastened
and
at
least
six
inch
open
no
lock
no
bolt
all
the
time
all
that
time
the
old
woman
had
not
shut
it
after
him
perhaps
a
a
precaution
but
good
god
why
he
had
seen
lizaveta
afterwards
and
how
could
he
how
could
he
have
failed
to
reflect
that
she
must
have
come
in
somehow
she
could
not
have
come
through
the
wall
he
dashed
to
the
door
and
fastened
the
latch
but
no
the
wrong
thing
again
i
must
get
away
get
away
he
unfastened
the
latch
opened
the
door
and
began
listening
on
the
staircase
he
listened
a
long
time
somewhere
far
away
it
might
be
in
the
gateway
two
voice
were
loudly
and
shrilly
shouting
quarrelling
and
scolding
what
are
they
about
he
waited
patiently
at
last
all
wa
still
a
though
suddenly
cut
off
they
had
separated
he
wa
meaning
to
go
out
but
suddenly
on
the
floor
below
a
door
wa
noisily
opened
and
someone
began
going
downstairs
humming
a
tune
how
is
it
they
all
make
such
a
noise
flashed
through
his
mind
once
more
he
closed
the
door
and
waited
at
last
all
wa
still
not
a
soul
stirring
he
wa
just
taking
a
step
towards
the
stair
when
he
heard
fresh
footstep
the
step
sounded
very
far
off
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
stair
but
he
remembered
quite
clearly
and
distinctly
that
from
the
first
sound
he
began
for
some
reason
to
suspect
that
this
wa
someone
coming
to
the
fourth
floor
to
the
old
woman
why
were
the
sound
somehow
peculiar
significant
the
step
were
heavy
even
and
unhurried
now
had
passed
the
first
floor
now
he
wa
mounting
higher
it
wa
growing
more
and
more
distinct
he
could
hear
his
heavy
breathing
and
now
the
third
storey
had
been
reached
coming
here
and
it
seemed
to
him
all
at
once
that
he
wa
turned
to
stone
that
it
wa
like
a
dream
in
which
one
is
being
pursued
nearly
caught
and
will
be
killed
and
is
rooted
to
the
spot
and
can
not
even
move
one
s
arm
at
last
when
the
unknown
wa
mounting
to
the
fourth
floor
he
suddenly
started
and
succeeded
in
slipping
neatly
and
quickly
back
into
the
flat
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
then
he
took
the
hook
and
softly
noiselessly
fixed
it
in
the
catch
instinct
helped
him
when
he
had
done
this
he
crouched
holding
his
breath
by
the
door
the
unknown
visitor
wa
by
now
also
at
the
door
they
were
now
standing
opposite
one
another
a
he
had
just
before
been
standing
with
the
old
woman
when
the
door
divided
them
and
he
wa
listening
the
visitor
panted
several
time
he
must
be
a
big
fat
man
thought
raskolnikov
squeezing
the
axe
in
his
hand
it
seemed
like
a
dream
indeed
the
visitor
took
hold
of
the
bell
and
rang
it
loudly
a
soon
a
the
tin
bell
tinkled
raskolnikov
seemed
to
be
aware
of
something
moving
in
the
room
for
some
second
he
listened
quite
seriously
the
unknown
rang
again
waited
and
suddenly
tugged
violently
and
impatiently
at
the
handle
of
the
door
raskolnikov
gazed
in
horror
at
the
hook
shaking
in
it
fastening
and
in
blank
terror
expected
every
minute
that
the
fastening
would
be
pulled
out
it
certainly
did
seem
possible
so
violently
wa
he
shaking
it
he
wa
tempted
to
hold
the
fastening
but
might
be
aware
of
it
a
giddiness
came
over
him
again
i
shall
fall
down
flashed
through
his
mind
but
the
unknown
began
to
speak
and
he
recovered
himself
at
once
what
s
up
are
they
asleep
or
murdered
them
he
bawled
in
a
thick
voice
hey
alyona
ivanovna
old
witch
lizaveta
ivanovna
hey
my
beauty
open
the
door
oh
damn
them
are
they
asleep
or
what
and
again
enraged
he
tugged
with
all
his
might
a
dozen
time
at
the
bell
he
must
certainly
be
a
man
of
authority
and
an
intimate
acquaintance
at
this
moment
light
hurried
step
were
heard
not
far
off
on
the
stair
someone
else
wa
approaching
raskolnikov
had
not
heard
them
at
first
you
don
t
say
there
s
no
one
at
home
the
cried
in
a
cheerful
ringing
voice
addressing
the
first
visitor
who
still
went
on
pulling
the
bell
good
evening
from
his
voice
he
must
be
quite
young
thought
raskolnikov
who
the
devil
can
tell
i
ve
almost
broken
the
lock
answered
koch
but

to
know
me
why
the
day
before
yesterday
i
beat

time
running
at
billiards
at
gambrinus
oh

home
that
s
queer
it
s
awfully
stupid
though
where

the
old
woman

i
have

i
suppose
aie

and
i
wa
hoping
to

some
money
cried
the
young
man
we
must
give
it
up
of
course
but
what
did
she
fix
this
time
for
the
old
witch
fixed
the
time
for
me
to
come
herself
it
s
out
of
my
way
and
where
the
devil
she
can
have
got
to
i
can
t
make
out
she
sits
here
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
the
old
hag
her
leg
are
bad
and
yet
here
all
of
a
sudden
she
is
out
for
a
walk
hadn
t
we
better
ask
the
porter
what
where
she
s
gone
and
when
she
ll
be
hm
damn
it
all
we
might
ask
but
you
know
she
never
doe
go
and
he
once
more
tugged
at
the
damn
it
all
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
we
must
go
stay
cried
the
young
man
suddenly
do
you
see
how
the
door
shake
if
you
pull
it
well
that
show
it
s
not
locked
but
fastened
with
the
hook
do
you
hear
how
the
hook
clank
well
why
don
t
you
see
that
prof
that
one
of
them
is
at
home
if
they
were
all
out
they
would
have
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
with
the
key
and
not
with
the
hook
from
inside
there
do
you
hear
how
the
hook
is
clanking
to
fasten
the
hook
on
the
inside
they
must
be
at
home
don
t
you
see
so
there
they
are
sitting
inside
and
don
t
open
the
door
well
and
so
they
must
be
cried
koch
astonished
what
are
they
about
in
there
and
he
began
furiously
shaking
the
door
stay
cried
the
young
man
again
don
t
pull
at
it
there
must
be
something
wrong
here
you
ve
been
ringing
and
pulling
at
the
door
and
still
they
don
t
open
so
either
they
ve
both
fainted
or
what
i
tell
you
what
let
s
go
fetch
the
porter
let
him
wake
them
all
both
were
going
down
stay
you
stop
here
while
i
run
down
for
the
what
for
well
you
d
all
i
m
studying
the
law
you
see
it
s
evident
there
s
something
wrong
here
the
young
man
cried
hotly
and
he
ran
downstairs
koch
remained
once
more
he
softly
touched
the
bell
which
gave
one
tinkle
then
gently
a
though
reflecting
and
looking
about
him
began
touching
the
pulling
it
and
letting
it
go
to
make
sure
once
more
that
it
wa
only
fastened
by
the
hook
then
puffing
and
panting
he
bent
down
and
began
looking
at
the
keyhole
but
the
key
wa
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
and
so
nothing
could
be
seen
raskolnikov
stood
keeping
tight
hold
of
the
axe
he
wa
in
a
sort
of
delirium
he
wa
even
making
ready
to
fight
when
they
should
come
in
while
they
were
knocking
and
talking
together
the
idea
several
time
occurred
to
him
to
end
it
all
at
once
and
shout
to
them
through
the
door
now
and
then
he
wa
tempted
to
swear
at
them
to
jeer
at
them
while
they
could
not
open
the
door
only
make
haste
wa
the
thought
that
flashed
through
his
mind
but
what
the
devil
is
he
about
time
wa
passing
one
minute
and
another
no
one
came
koch
began
to
be
restless
what
the
devil
he
cried
suddenly
and
in
impatience
deserting
his
sentry
duty
he
too
went
down
hurrying
and
thumping
with
his
heavy
boot
on
the
stair
the
step
died
away
good
heaven
what
am
i
to
do
raskolnikov
unfastened
the
hook
opened
the
door
there
wa
no
sound
abruptly
without
any
thought
at
all
he
went
out
closing
the
door
a
thoroughly
a
he
could
and
went
downstairs
he
had
gone
down
three
flight
when
he
suddenly
heard
a
loud
voice
below
where
could
he
go
there
wa
nowhere
to
hide
he
wa
just
going
back
to
the
flat
hey
there
catch
the
brute
somebody
dashed
out
of
a
flat
below
shouting
and
rather
fell
than
ran
down
the
stair
bawling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
mitka
mitka
mitka
mitka
mitka
blast
him
the
shout
ended
in
a
shriek
the
last
sound
came
from
the
yard
all
wa
still
but
at
the
same
instant
several
men
talking
loud
and
fast
began
noisily
mounting
the
stair
there
were
three
or
four
of
them
he
distinguished
the
ringing
voice
of
the
young
man
hey
filled
with
despair
he
went
straight
to
meet
them
feeling
come
what
must
if
they
stopped
him
all
wa
lost
if
they
let
him
pas
all
wa
lost
too
they
would
remember
him
they
were
approaching
they
were
only
a
flight
from
him
and
suddenly
deliverance
a
few
step
from
him
on
the
right
there
wa
an
empty
flat
with
the
door
wide
open
the
flat
on
the
second
floor
where
the
painter
had
been
at
work
and
which
a
though
for
his
benefit
they
had
just
left
it
wa
they
no
doubt
who
had
just
run
down
shouting
the
floor
had
only
just
been
painted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
pail
and
a
broken
pot
with
paint
and
brush
in
one
instant
he
had
whisked
in
at
the
open
door
and
hidden
behind
the
wall
and
only
in
the
nick
of
time
they
had
already
reached
the
landing
then
they
turned
and
went
on
up
to
the
fourth
floor
talking
loudly
he
waited
went
out
on
tiptoe
and
ran
down
the
stair
no
one
wa
on
the
stair
nor
in
the
gateway
he
passed
quickly
through
the
gateway
and
turned
to
the
left
in
the
street
he
knew
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
at
that
moment
they
were
at
the
flat
that
they
were
greatly
astonished
at
finding
it
unlocked
a
the
door
had
just
been
fastened
that
by
now
they
were
looking
at
the
body
that
before
another
minute
had
passed
they
would
guess
and
completely
realise
that
the
murderer
had
just
been
there
and
had
succeeded
in
hiding
somewhere
slipping
by
them
and
escaping
they
would
guess
most
likely
that
he
had
been
in
the
empty
flat
while
they
were
going
upstairs
and
meanwhile
he
dared
not
quicken
his
pace
much
though
the
next
turning
wa
still
nearly
a
hundred
yard
away
should
he
slip
through
some
gateway
and
wait
somewhere
in
an
unknown
street
no
hopeless
should
he
fling
away
the
axe
should
he
take
a
cab
hopeless
hopeless
at
last
he
reached
the
turning
he
turned
down
it
more
dead
than
alive
here
he
wa
half
way
to
safety
and
he
understood
it
it
wa
less
risky
because
there
wa
a
great
crowd
of
people
and
he
wa
lost
in
it
like
a
grain
of
sand
but
all
he
had
suffered
had
so
weakened
him
that
he
could
scarcely
move
perspiration
ran
down
him
in
drop
his
neck
wa
all
wet
my
word
he
ha
been
going
it
someone
shouted
at
him
when
he
came
out
on
the
canal
bank
he
wa
only
dimly
conscious
of
himself
now
and
the
farther
he
went
the
worse
it
wa
he
remembered
however
that
on
coming
out
on
to
the
canal
bank
he
wa
alarmed
at
finding
few
people
there
and
so
being
more
conspicuous
and
he
had
thought
of
turning
back
though
he
wa
almost
falling
from
fatigue
he
went
a
long
way
round
so
a
to
get
home
from
quite
a
different
direction
he
wa
not
fully
conscious
when
he
passed
through
the
gateway
of
his
house
he
wa
already
on
the
staircase
before
he
recollected
the
axe
and
yet
he
had
a
very
grave
problem
before
him
to
put
it
back
and
to
escape
observation
a
far
a
possible
in
doing
so
he
wa
of
course
incapable
of
reflecting
that
it
might
perhaps
be
far
better
not
to
restore
the
axe
at
all
but
to
drop
it
later
on
in
somebody
s
yard
but
it
all
happened
fortunately
the
door
of
the
porter
s
room
wa
closed
but
not
locked
so
that
it
seemed
most
likely
that
the
porter
wa
at
home
but
he
had
so
completely
lost
all
power
of
reflection
that
he
walked
straight
to
the
door
and
opened
it
if
the
porter
had
asked
him
what
do
you
want
he
would
perhaps
have
simply
handed
him
the
axe
but
again
the
porter
wa
not
at
home
and
he
succeeded
in
putting
the
axe
back
under
the
bench
and
even
covering
it
with
the
chunk
of
wood
a
before
he
met
no
one
not
a
soul
afterwards
on
the
way
to
his
room
the
landlady
s
door
wa
shut
when
he
wa
in
his
room
he
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
just
a
he
wa
he
did
not
sleep
but
sank
into
blank
forgetfulness
if
anyone
had
come
into
his
room
then
he
would
have
jumped
up
at
once
and
screamed
scrap
and
shred
of
thought
were
simply
swarming
in
his
brain
but
he
could
not
catch
at
one
he
could
not
rest
on
one
in
spite
of
all
his
effort
part
ii
chapter
i
so
he
lay
a
very
long
while
now
and
then
he
seemed
to
wake
up
and
at
such
moment
he
noticed
that
it
wa
far
into
the
night
but
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
get
up
at
last
he
noticed
that
it
wa
beginning
to
get
light
he
wa
lying
on
his
back
still
dazed
from
his
recent
oblivion
fearful
despairing
cry
rose
shrilly
from
the
street
sound
which
he
heard
every
night
indeed
under
his
window
after
two
o
clock
they
woke
him
up
now
ah
the
drunken
men
are
coming
out
of
the
tavern
he
thought
it
s
past
two
o
clock
and
at
once
he
leaped
up
a
though
someone
had
pulled
him
from
the
sofa
what
past
two
o
clock
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
instantly
recollected
everything
all
at
once
in
one
flash
he
recollected
everything
for
the
first
moment
he
thought
he
wa
going
mad
a
dreadful
chill
came
over
him
but
the
chill
wa
from
the
fever
that
had
begun
long
before
in
his
sleep
now
he
wa
suddenly
taken
with
violent
shivering
so
that
his
teeth
chattered
and
all
his
limb
were
shaking
he
opened
the
door
and
began
listening
everything
in
the
house
wa
asleep
with
amazement
he
gazed
at
himself
and
everything
in
the
room
around
him
wondering
how
he
could
have
come
in
the
night
before
without
fastening
the
door
and
have
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
without
undressing
without
even
taking
his
hat
off
it
had
fallen
off
and
wa
lying
on
the
floor
near
his
pillow
if
anyone
had
come
in
what
would
he
have
thought
that
i
m
drunk
but
he
rushed
to
the
window
there
wa
light
enough
and
he
began
hurriedly
looking
himself
all
over
from
head
to
foot
all
his
clothes
were
there
no
trace
but
there
wa
no
doing
it
like
that
shivering
with
cold
he
began
taking
off
everything
and
looking
over
again
he
turned
everything
over
to
the
last
thread
and
rag
and
mistrusting
himself
went
through
his
search
three
time
but
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
no
trace
except
in
one
place
where
some
thick
drop
of
congealed
blood
were
clinging
to
the
frayed
edge
of
his
trouser
he
picked
up
a
big
claspknife
and
cut
off
the
frayed
thread
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
suddenly
he
remembered
that
the
purse
and
the
thing
he
had
taken
out
of
the
old
woman
s
box
were
still
in
his
pocket
he
had
not
thought
till
then
of
taking
them
out
and
hiding
them
he
had
not
even
thought
of
them
while
he
wa
examining
his
clothes
what
next
instantly
he
rushed
to
take
them
out
and
fling
them
on
the
table
when
he
had
pulled
out
everything
and
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
to
be
sure
there
wa
nothing
left
he
carried
the
whole
heap
to
the
corner
the
paper
had
come
off
the
bottom
of
the
wall
and
hung
there
in
tatter
he
began
stuffing
all
the
thing
into
the
hole
under
the
paper
they
re
in
all
out
of
sight
and
the
purse
too
he
thought
gleefully
getting
up
and
gazing
blankly
at
the
hole
which
bulged
out
more
than
ever
suddenly
he
shuddered
all
over
with
horror
my
god
he
whispered
in
despair
what
s
the
matter
with
me
is
that
hidden
is
that
the
way
to
hide
thing
he
had
not
reckoned
on
having
trinket
to
hide
he
had
only
thought
of
money
and
so
had
not
prepared
a
but
now
now
what
am
i
glad
of
he
thought
is
that
hiding
thing
my
reason
s
deserting
me
simply
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
exhaustion
and
wa
at
once
shaken
by
another
unbearable
fit
of
shivering
mechanically
he
drew
from
a
chair
beside
him
his
old
student
s
winter
coat
which
wa
still
warm
though
almost
in
rag
covered
himself
up
with
it
and
once
more
sank
into
drowsiness
and
delirium
he
lost
consciousness
not
more
than
five
minute
had
passed
when
he
jumped
up
a
second
time
and
at
once
pounced
in
a
frenzy
on
his
clothes
again
how
could
i
go
to
sleep
again
with
nothing
done
yes
yes
i
have
not
taken
the
loop
off
the
armhole
i
forgot
it
forgot
a
thing
like
that
such
a
piece
of
evidence
he
pulled
off
the
noose
hurriedly
cut
it
to
piece
and
threw
the
bit
among
his
linen
under
the
pillow
piece
of
torn
linen
couldn
t
rouse
suspicion
whatever
happened
i
think
not
i
think
not
any
way
he
repeated
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
with
painful
concentration
he
fell
to
gazing
about
him
again
at
the
floor
and
everywhere
trying
to
make
sure
he
had
not
forgotten
anything
the
conviction
that
all
his
faculty
even
memory
and
the
simplest
power
of
reflection
were
failing
him
began
to
be
an
insufferable
torture
surely
it
isn
t
beginning
already
surely
it
isn
t
my
punishment
coming
upon
me
it
is
the
frayed
rag
he
had
cut
off
his
trouser
were
actually
lying
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
anyone
coming
in
would
see
them
what
is
the
matter
with
me
he
cried
again
like
one
distraught
then
a
strange
idea
entered
his
head
that
perhaps
all
his
clothes
were
covered
with
blood
that
perhaps
there
were
a
great
many
stain
but
that
he
did
not
see
them
did
not
notice
them
because
his
perception
were
failing
were
going
to
piece
his
reason
wa
clouded
suddenly
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
blood
on
the
purse
too
ah
then
there
must
be
blood
on
the
pocket
too
for
i
put
the
wet
purse
in
my
pocket
in
a
flash
he
had
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
and
yes
there
were
trace
stain
on
the
lining
of
the
pocket
so
my
reason
ha
not
quite
deserted
me
so
i
still
have
some
sense
and
memory
since
i
guessed
it
of
myself
he
thought
triumphantly
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
it
s
simply
the
weakness
of
fever
a
moment
s
delirium
and
he
tore
the
whole
lining
out
of
the
left
pocket
of
his
trouser
at
that
instant
the
sunlight
fell
on
his
left
boot
on
the
sock
which
poked
out
from
the
boot
he
fancied
there
were
trace
he
flung
off
his
boot
trace
indeed
the
tip
of
the
sock
wa
soaked
with
blood
he
must
have
unwarily
stepped
into
that
pool
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
now
where
am
i
to
put
the
sock
and
rag
and
pocket
he
gathered
them
all
up
in
his
hand
and
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
the
stove
but
they
would
ransack
the
stove
first
of
all
burn
them
but
what
can
i
burn
them
with
there
are
no
match
even
no
better
go
out
and
throw
it
all
away
somewhere
yes
better
throw
it
away
he
repeated
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
again
and
at
once
this
minute
without
lingering
but
his
head
sank
on
the
pillow
instead
again
the
unbearable
icy
shivering
came
over
him
again
he
drew
his
coat
over
him
and
for
a
long
while
for
some
hour
he
wa
haunted
by
the
impulse
to
go
off
somewhere
at
once
this
moment
and
fling
it
all
away
so
that
it
may
be
out
of
sight
and
done
with
at
once
at
once
several
time
he
tried
to
rise
from
the
sofa
but
could
not
he
wa
thoroughly
waked
up
at
last
by
a
violent
knocking
at
his
door
open
do
are
you
dead
or
alive
he
keep
sleeping
here
shouted
nastasya
banging
with
her
fist
on
the
door
for
whole
day
together
he
s
snoring
here
like
a
dog
a
dog
he
is
too
open
i
tell
you
it
s
past
maybe
he
s
not
at
home
said
a
man
s
voice
ha
that
s
the
porter
s
voice
what
doe
he
want
he
jumped
up
and
sat
on
the
sofa
the
beating
of
his
heart
wa
a
positive
pain
then
who
can
have
latched
the
door
retorted
nastasya
he
s
taken
to
bolting
himself
in
a
if
he
were
worth
stealing
open
you
stupid
wake
up
what
do
they
want
why
the
porter
all
s
discovered
resist
or
open
come
what
may
he
half
rose
stooped
forward
and
unlatched
the
door
his
room
wa
so
small
that
he
could
undo
the
latch
without
leaving
the
bed
yes
the
porter
and
nastasya
were
standing
there
nastasya
stared
at
him
in
a
strange
way
he
glanced
with
a
defiant
and
desperate
air
at
the
porter
who
without
a
word
held
out
a
grey
folded
paper
sealed
with
a
notice
from
the
office
he
announced
a
he
gave
him
the
paper
from
what
office
a
summons
to
the
police
office
of
course
you
know
which
to
the
police
what
for
how
can
i
tell
you
re
sent
for
so
you
the
man
looked
at
him
attentively
looked
round
the
room
and
turned
to
go
away
he
s
downright
ill
observed
nastasya
not
taking
her
eye
off
him
the
porter
turned
his
head
for
a
moment
he
s
been
in
a
fever
since
yesterday
she
added
raskolnikov
made
no
response
and
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
without
opening
it
don
t
you
get
up
then
nastasya
went
on
compassionately
seeing
that
he
wa
letting
his
foot
down
from
the
sofa
you
re
ill
and
so
don
t
go
there
s
no
such
hurry
what
have
you
got
there
he
looked
in
his
right
hand
he
held
the
shred
he
had
cut
from
his
trouser
the
sock
and
the
rag
of
the
pocket
so
he
had
been
asleep
with
them
in
his
hand
afterwards
reflecting
upon
it
he
remembered
that
half
waking
up
in
his
fever
he
had
grasped
all
this
tightly
in
his
hand
and
so
fallen
asleep
again
look
at
the
rag
he
s
collected
and
sleep
with
them
a
though
he
ha
got
hold
of
a
treasure
and
nastasya
went
off
into
her
hysterical
giggle
instantly
he
thrust
them
all
under
his
great
coat
and
fixed
his
eye
intently
upon
her
far
a
he
wa
from
being
capable
of
rational
reflection
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
no
one
would
behave
like
that
with
a
person
who
wa
going
to
be
arrested
but
the
police
you
d
better
have
some
tea
yes
i
ll
bring
it
there
s
some
no
i
m
going
i
ll
go
at
once
he
muttered
getting
on
to
his
foot
why
you
ll
never
get
downstairs
yes
i
ll
a
you
she
followed
the
porter
out
at
once
he
rushed
to
the
light
to
examine
the
sock
and
the
rag
there
are
stain
but
not
very
noticeable
all
covered
with
dirt
and
rubbed
and
already
discoloured
no
one
who
had
no
suspicion
could
distinguish
anything
nastasya
from
a
distance
could
not
have
noticed
thank
god
then
with
a
tremor
he
broke
the
seal
of
the
notice
and
began
reading
he
wa
a
long
while
reading
before
he
understood
it
wa
an
ordinary
summons
from
the
district
to
appear
that
day
at
nine
at
the
office
of
the
district
superintendent
but
when
ha
such
a
thing
happened
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
the
police
and
why
just
he
thought
in
agonising
bewilderment
good
god
only
get
it
over
soon
he
wa
flinging
himself
on
his
knee
to
pray
but
broke
into
laughter
not
at
the
idea
of
prayer
but
at
himself
he
began
hurriedly
dressing
if
i
m
lost
i
am
lost
i
don
t
care
shall
i
put
the
sock
on
he
suddenly
wondered
it
will
get
dustier
still
and
the
trace
will
be
but
no
sooner
had
he
put
it
on
than
he
pulled
it
off
again
in
loathing
and
horror
he
pulled
it
off
but
reflecting
that
he
had
no
other
sock
he
picked
it
up
and
put
it
on
again
and
again
he
laughed
that
s
all
conventional
that
s
all
relative
merely
a
way
of
looking
at
it
he
thought
in
a
flash
but
only
on
the
top
surface
of
his
mind
while
he
wa
shuddering
all
over
there
i
ve
got
it
on
i
have
finished
by
getting
it
on
but
his
laughter
wa
quickly
followed
by
despair
no
it
s
too
much
for
me
he
thought
his
leg
shook
from
fear
he
muttered
his
head
swam
and
ached
with
fever
it
s
a
trick
they
want
to
decoy
me
there
and
confound
me
over
everything
he
mused
a
he
went
out
on
to
the
stair
the
worst
of
it
is
i
m
almost
i
may
blurt
out
something
stupid
on
the
stair
he
remembered
that
he
wa
leaving
all
the
thing
just
a
they
were
in
the
hole
in
the
wall
and
very
likely
it
s
on
purpose
to
search
when
i
m
out
he
thought
and
stopped
short
but
he
wa
possessed
by
such
despair
such
cynicism
of
misery
if
one
may
so
call
it
that
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
went
on
only
to
get
it
over
in
the
street
the
heat
wa
insufferable
again
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
all
those
day
again
dust
brick
and
mortar
again
the
stench
from
the
shop
and
again
the
drunken
men
the
finnish
pedlar
and
cab
the
sun
shone
straight
in
his
eye
so
that
it
hurt
him
to
look
out
of
them
and
he
felt
his
head
going
round
a
a
man
in
a
fever
is
apt
to
feel
when
he
come
out
into
the
street
on
a
bright
sunny
day
when
he
reached
the
turning
into
street
in
an
agony
of
trepidation
he
looked
down
it
at
house
and
at
once
averted
his
eye
if
they
question
me
perhaps
i
ll
simply
tell
he
thought
a
he
drew
near
the
the
wa
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
it
had
lately
been
moved
to
new
room
on
the
fourth
floor
of
a
new
house
he
had
been
once
for
a
moment
in
the
old
office
but
long
ago
turning
in
at
the
gateway
he
saw
on
the
right
a
flight
of
stair
which
a
peasant
wa
mounting
with
a
book
in
his
hand
a
no
doubt
so
then
the
office
is
here
and
he
began
ascending
the
stair
on
the
chance
he
did
not
want
to
ask
question
of
anyone
i
ll
go
in
fall
on
my
knee
and
confess
everything
he
thought
a
he
reached
the
fourth
floor
the
staircase
wa
steep
narrow
and
all
sloppy
with
dirty
water
the
kitchen
of
the
flat
opened
on
to
the
stair
and
stood
open
almost
the
whole
day
so
there
wa
a
fearful
smell
and
heat
the
staircase
wa
crowded
with
porter
going
up
and
down
with
their
book
under
their
arm
policeman
and
person
of
all
sort
and
both
sex
the
door
of
the
office
too
stood
wide
open
peasant
stood
waiting
within
there
too
the
heat
wa
stifling
and
there
wa
a
sickening
smell
of
fresh
paint
and
stale
oil
from
the
newly
decorated
room
after
waiting
a
little
he
decided
to
move
forward
into
the
next
room
all
the
room
were
small
and
a
fearful
impatience
drew
him
on
and
on
no
one
paid
attention
to
him
in
the
second
room
some
clerk
sat
writing
dressed
hardly
better
than
he
wa
and
rather
a
set
he
went
up
to
one
of
them
what
is
it
he
showed
the
notice
he
had
received
you
are
a
student
the
man
asked
glancing
at
the
notice
yes
formerly
a
the
clerk
looked
at
him
but
without
the
slightest
interest
he
wa
a
particularly
unkempt
person
with
the
look
of
a
fixed
idea
in
his
eye
there
would
be
no
getting
anything
out
of
him
because
he
ha
no
interest
in
anything
thought
raskolnikov
go
in
there
to
the
head
clerk
said
the
clerk
pointing
towards
the
furthest
room
he
went
into
that
room
the
fourth
in
order
it
wa
a
small
room
and
packed
full
of
people
rather
better
dressed
than
in
the
outer
room
among
them
were
two
lady
one
poorly
dressed
in
mourning
sat
at
the
table
opposite
the
chief
clerk
writing
something
at
his
dictation
the
other
a
very
stout
buxom
woman
with
a
blotchy
face
excessively
smartly
dressed
with
a
brooch
on
her
bosom
a
big
a
a
saucer
wa
standing
on
one
side
apparently
waiting
for
something
raskolnikov
thrust
his
notice
upon
the
head
clerk
the
latter
glanced
at
it
said
wait
a
minute
and
went
on
attending
to
the
lady
in
mourning
he
breathed
more
freely
it
can
t
be
that
by
degree
he
began
to
regain
confidence
he
kept
urging
himself
to
have
courage
and
be
calm
some
foolishness
some
trifling
carelessness
and
i
may
betray
myself
hm
it
s
a
pity
there
s
no
air
here
he
added
it
s
stifling
it
make
one
s
head
dizzier
than
ever
and
one
s
mind
too
he
wa
conscious
of
a
terrible
inner
turmoil
he
wa
afraid
of
losing
his
he
tried
to
catch
at
something
and
fix
his
mind
on
it
something
quite
irrelevant
but
he
could
not
succeed
in
this
at
all
yet
the
head
clerk
greatly
interested
him
he
kept
hoping
to
see
through
him
and
guess
something
from
his
face
he
wa
a
very
young
man
about
two
and
twenty
with
a
dark
mobile
face
that
looked
older
than
his
year
he
wa
fashionably
dressed
and
foppish
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
well
combed
and
pomaded
and
wore
a
number
of
ring
on
his
finger
and
a
gold
chain
on
his
waistcoat
he
said
a
couple
of
word
in
french
to
a
foreigner
who
wa
in
the
room
and
said
them
fairly
correctly
luise
ivanovna
you
can
sit
down
he
said
casually
to
the
lady
who
wa
still
standing
a
though
not
venturing
to
sit
down
though
there
wa
a
chair
beside
her
ich
danke
said
the
latter
and
softly
with
a
rustle
of
silk
she
sank
into
the
chair
her
light
blue
dress
trimmed
with
white
lace
floated
about
the
table
like
an
and
filled
almost
half
the
room
she
smelt
of
scent
but
she
wa
obviously
embarrassed
at
filling
half
the
room
and
smelling
so
strongly
of
scent
and
though
her
smile
wa
impudent
a
well
a
cringing
it
betrayed
evident
uneasiness
the
lady
in
mourning
had
done
at
last
and
got
up
all
at
once
with
some
noise
an
officer
walked
in
very
jauntily
with
a
peculiar
swing
of
his
shoulder
at
each
step
he
tossed
his
cockaded
cap
on
the
table
and
sat
down
in
an
the
small
lady
positively
skipped
from
her
seat
on
seeing
him
and
fell
to
curtsying
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
but
the
officer
took
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
and
she
did
not
venture
to
sit
down
again
in
his
presence
he
wa
the
assistant
superintendent
he
had
a
reddish
moustache
that
stood
out
horizontally
on
each
side
of
his
face
and
extremely
small
feature
expressive
of
nothing
much
except
a
certain
insolence
he
looked
askance
and
rather
indignantly
at
raskolnikov
he
wa
so
very
badly
dressed
and
in
spite
of
his
humiliating
position
his
bearing
wa
by
no
mean
in
keeping
with
his
clothes
raskolnikov
had
unwarily
fixed
a
very
long
and
direct
look
on
him
so
that
he
felt
positively
affronted
what
do
you
want
he
shouted
apparently
astonished
that
such
a
ragged
fellow
wa
not
annihilated
by
the
majesty
of
his
glance
i
wa
summoned
by
a
notice
raskolnikov
faltered
for
the
recovery
of
money
due
from
the
head
clerk
interfered
hurriedly
tearing
himself
from
his
paper
here
and
he
flung
raskolnikov
a
document
and
pointed
out
the
place
read
that
money
what
money
thought
raskolnikov
but
then
it
s
certainly
not
and
he
trembled
with
joy
he
felt
sudden
intense
indescribable
relief
a
load
wa
lifted
from
his
back
and
pray
what
time
were
you
directed
to
appear
sir
shouted
the
assistant
superintendent
seeming
for
some
unknown
reason
more
and
more
aggrieved
you
are
told
to
come
at
nine
and
now
it
s
twelve
the
notice
wa
only
brought
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
raskolnikov
answered
loudly
over
his
shoulder
to
his
own
surprise
he
too
grew
suddenly
angry
and
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
it
and
it
s
enough
that
i
have
come
here
ill
with
kindly
refrain
from
shouting
i
m
not
shouting
i
m
speaking
very
quietly
it
s
you
who
are
shouting
at
me
i
m
a
student
and
allow
no
one
to
shout
at
the
assistant
superintendent
wa
so
furious
that
for
the
first
minute
he
could
only
splutter
inarticulately
he
leaped
up
from
his
seat
be
silent
you
are
in
a
government
office
don
t
be
impudent
sir
you
re
in
a
government
office
too
cried
raskolnikov
and
you
re
smoking
a
cigarette
a
well
a
shouting
so
you
are
showing
disrespect
to
all
of
he
felt
an
indescribable
satisfaction
at
having
said
this
the
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
the
angry
assistant
superintendent
wa
obviously
disconcerted
that
s
not
your
business
he
shouted
at
last
with
unnatural
loudness
kindly
make
the
declaration
demanded
of
you
show
him
alexandr
grigorievitch
there
is
a
complaint
against
you
you
don
t
pay
your
debt
you
re
a
fine
bird
but
raskolnikov
wa
not
listening
now
he
had
eagerly
clutched
at
the
paper
in
haste
to
find
an
explanation
he
read
it
once
and
a
second
time
and
still
did
not
understand
what
is
this
he
asked
the
head
clerk
it
is
for
the
recovery
of
money
on
an
i
o
u
a
writ
you
must
either
pay
it
with
all
expense
cost
and
so
on
or
give
a
written
declaration
when
you
can
pay
it
and
at
the
same
time
an
undertaking
not
to
leave
the
capital
without
payment
and
nor
to
sell
or
conceal
your
property
the
creditor
is
at
liberty
to
sell
your
property
and
proceed
against
you
according
to
the
but
i
am
not
in
debt
to
anyone
that

hundred

and
due

for

by

the
widow
of

nine
month
ago
and
paid
over
by
the
widow
zarnitsyn
to
one
tchebarov
we
therefore
summon
you
but
she
is
my
landlady
and
what
if
she
is
your
landlady
the
head
clerk
looked
at
him
with
a
condescending
smile
of
compassion
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
certain
triumph
a
at
a
novice
under
fire
for
the
first
time
a
though
he
would
say
well
how
do
you
feel
now
but
what
did
he
care
now
for
an
i
o
u
for
a
writ
of
recovery
wa
that
worth
worrying
about
now
wa
it
worth
attention
even
he
stood
he
read
he
listened
he
answered
he
even
asked
question
himself
but
all
mechanically
the
triumphant
sense
of
security
of
deliverance
from
overwhelming
danger
that
wa
what
filled
his
whole
soul
that
moment
without
thought
for
the
future
without
analysis
without
supposition
or
surmise
without
doubt
and
without
questioning
it
wa
an
instant
of
full
direct
purely
instinctive
joy
but
at
that
very
moment
something
like
a
thunderstorm
took
place
in
the
office
the
assistant
superintendent
still
shaken
by
raskolnikov
s
disrespect
still
fuming
and
obviously
anxious
to
keep
up
his
wounded
dignity
pounced
on
the
unfortunate
smart
lady
who
had
been
gazing
at
him
ever
since
he
came
in
with
an
exceedingly
silly
smile
you
shameful
hussy
he
shouted
suddenly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
lady
in
mourning
had
left
the
office
what
wa
going
on
at
your
house
last
night
eh
a
disgrace
again
you
re
a
scandal
to
the
whole
street
fighting
and
drinking
again
do
you
want
the
house
of
correction
why
i
have
warned
you
ten
time
over
that
i
would
not
let
you
off
the
eleventh
and
here
you
are
again
again
you
you
the
paper
fell
out
of
raskolnikov
s
hand
and
he
looked
wildly
at
the
smart
lady
who
wa
so
unceremoniously
treated
but
he
soon
saw
what
it
meant
and
at
once
began
to
find
positive
amusement
in
the
scandal
he
listened
with
pleasure
so
that
he
longed
to
laugh
and
laugh
all
his
nerve
were
on

petrovitch
the
head
clerk
wa
beginning
anxiously
but
stopped
short
for
he
knew
from
experience
that
the
enraged
assistant
could
not
be
stopped
except
by
force
a
for
the
smart
lady
at
first
she
positively
trembled
before
the
storm
but
strange
to
say
the
more
numerous
and
violent
the
term
of
abuse
became
the
more
amiable
she
looked
and
the
more
seductive
the
smile
she
lavished
on
the
terrible
assistant
she
moved
uneasily
and
curtsied
incessantly
waiting
impatiently
for
a
chance
of
putting
in
her
word
and
at
last
she
found
it
there
wa
no
sort
of
noise
or
fighting
in
my
house
captain
she
pattered
all
at
once
like
pea
dropping
speaking
russian
confidently
though
with
a
strong
german
accent
and
no
sort
of
scandal
and
his
honour
came
drunk
and
it
s
the
whole
truth
i
am
telling
captain
and
i
am
not
to
blame
mine
is
an
honourable
house
captain
and
honourable
behaviour
captain
and
i
always
always
dislike
any
scandal
myself
but
he
came
quite
tipsy
and
asked
for
three
bottle
again
and
then
he
lifted
up
one
leg
and
began
playing
the
pianoforte
with
one
foot
and
that
is
not
at
all
right
in
an
honourable
house
and
he
broke
the
piano
and
it
wa
very
bad
manner
indeed
and
i
said
so
and
he
took
up
a
bottle
and
began
hitting
everyone
with
it
and
then
i
called
the
porter
and
karl
came
and
he
took
karl
and
hit
him
in
the
eye
and
he
hit
henriette
in
the
eye
too
and
gave
me
five
slap
on
the
cheek
and
it
wa
so
ungentlemanly
in
an
honourable
house
captain
and
i
screamed
and
he
opened
the
window
over
the
canal
and
stood
in
the
window
squealing
like
a
little
pig
it
wa
a
disgrace
the
idea
of
squealing
like
a
little
pig
at
the
window
into
the
street
fie
upon
him
and
karl
pulled
him
away
from
the
window
by
his
coat
and
it
is
true
captain
he
tore
and
then
he
shouted
that
pay
him
fifteen
rouble
damage
and
i
did
pay
him
captain
five
rouble
for
and
he
is
an
ungentlemanly
visitor
and
caused
all
the
scandal
i
will
show
you
up
he
said
for
i
can
write
to
all
the
paper
about

he
wa
an
author
yes
captain
and
what
an
ungentlemanly
visitor

an
honourable
house

enough
i
have
told
you

ilya
petrovitch
the
head
clerk
repeated
significantly
the
assistant

rapidly
at

head
clerk
slightly
shook
his
head

respectable
luise
ivanovna
and
i
tell

house

literary
man

for
his

an
honourable
house

nice
set

and
he
cast
a
contemptuous
glance
at
raskolnikov
there
wa
a
scandal
the
other
day
in
a
restaurant

most
disgraceful
language
to
the
respectable
family
of
a
civil
councillor

wife
and
daughter
and
there
wa
one
of

day

careful
do

with
hurried
deference
luise
ivanovna
fell
to
curtsying
in
all
direction
and
so
curtsied
herself
to
the
door
but
at
the
door
she
stumbled
backwards
against
a
officer
with
a
fresh
open
face
and
splendid
thick
fair
whisker
this
wa
the
superintendent
of
the
district
himself
nikodim
fomitch
luise
ivanovna
made
haste
to
curtsy
almost
to
the
ground
and
with
mincing
little
step
she
fluttered
out
of
the
office
again
thunder
and
lightning
a
hurricane
said
nikodim
fomitch
to
ilya
petrovitch
in
a
civil
and
friendly
tone
you
are
aroused
again
you
are
fuming
again
i
heard
it
on
the
stair
well
what
then
ilya
petrovitch
drawled
with
gentlemanly
nonchalance
and
he
walked
with
some
paper
to
another
table
with
a
jaunty
swing
of
his
shoulder
at
each
step
here
if
you
will
kindly
look
an
author
or
a
student
ha
been
one
at
least
doe
not

his
debt

given
an

won
t
clear
out
of
his
room
and
complaint
are
constantly
being
lodged
against
him
and
here
he
ha
been
pleased
to
make
a
protest
against
my
smoking
in
his
presence
he
behaves
like
a
cad
himself
and
just
look
at
him
please
here
s
the
gentleman
and
very
attractive
he
is
poverty
is
not
a
vice
my
friend
but
we
know
you
go
off
like
powder
you
can
t
bear
a
slight
i
daresay
you
took
offence
at
something
and
went
too
far
yourself
continued
nikodim
fomitch
turning
affably
to
raskolnikov
but
you
were
wrong
there
he
is
a
capital
fellow
i
assure
you
but
explosive
explosive
he
get
hot
fire
up
boil
over
and
no
stopping
him
and
then
it
s
all
over
and
at
the
bottom
he
s
a
heart
of
gold
his
nickname
in
the
regiment
wa
the
explosive
lieutenant
and
what
a
regiment
it
wa
too
cried
ilya
petrovitch
much
gratified
at
this
agreeable
banter
though
still
sulky
raskolnikov
had
a
sudden
desire
to
say
something
exceptionally
pleasant
to
them
all
excuse
me
captain
he
began
easily
suddenly
addressing
nikodim
fomitch
will
you
enter
into
my
position
i
am
ready
to
ask
pardon
if
i
have
been
i
am
a
poor
student
sick
and
shattered
shattered
wa
the
word
he
used
by
poverty
i
am
not
studying
because
i
can
not
keep
myself
now
but
i
shall
get
money
i
have
a
mother
and
sister
in
the
province
of
x
they
will
send
it
to
me
and
i
will
pay
my
landlady
is
a
woman
but
she
is
so
exasperated
at
my
having
lost
my
lesson
and
not
paying
her
for
the
last
four
month
that
she
doe
not
even
send
up
my
dinner
and
i
don
t
understand
this
i
o
u
at
all
she
is
asking
me
to
pay
her
on
this
i
o
u
how
am
i
to
pay
her
judge
for
yourselves
but
that
is
not
our
business
you
know
the
head
clerk
wa
observing
yes
yes
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
but
allow
me
to
explain
raskolnikov
put
in
again
still
addressing
nikodim
fomitch
but
trying
his
best
to
address
ilya
petrovitch
also
though
the
latter
persistently
appeared
to
be
rummaging
among
his
paper
and
to
be
contemptuously
oblivious
of
him
allow
me
to
explain
that
i
have
been
living
with
her
for
nearly
three
year
and
at
first
at
first
for
why
should
i
not
confess
it
at
the
very
beginning
i
promised
to
marry
her
daughter
it
wa
a
verbal
promise
freely
given
she
wa
a
girl
indeed
i
liked
her
though
i
wa
not
in
love
with
her
a
youthful
affair
in
fact
that
is
i
mean
to
say
that
my
landlady
gave
me
credit
freely
in
those
day
and
i
led
a
life
of
i
wa
very
heedless
nobody
asks
you
for
these
personal
detail
sir
we
ve
no
time
to
waste
ilya
petrovitch
interposed
roughly
and
with
a
note
of
triumph
but
raskolnikov
stopped
him
hotly
though
he
suddenly
found
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
speak
but
excuse
me
excuse
me
it
is
for
me
to
explain
how
it
all
happened
in
my
turn
though
i
agree
with
you
it
is
unnecessary
but
a
year
ago
the
girl
died
of
typhus
i
remained
lodging
there
a
before
and
when
my
landlady
moved
into
her
present
quarter
she
said
to
me
and
in
a
friendly
way
that
she
had
complete
trust
in
me
but
still
would
i
not
give
her
an
i
o
u
for
one
hundred
and
fifteen
rouble
all
the
debt
i
owed
her
she
said
if
only
i
gave
her
that
she
would
trust
me
again
a
much
a
i
liked
and
that
she
would
never
never
those
were
her
own
word
make
use
of
that
i
o
u
till
i
could
pay
of
myself
and
now
when
i
have
lost
my
lesson
and
have
nothing
to
eat
she
take
action
against
me
what
am
i
to
say
to
that
all
these
affecting
detail
are
no
business
of
ilya
petrovitch
interrupted
rudely
you
must
give
a
written
undertaking
but
a
for
your
love
affair
and
all
these
tragic
event
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
come
now
you
are
harsh
muttered
nikodim
fomitch
sitting
down
at
the
table
and
also
beginning
to
write
he
looked
a
little
ashamed
write
said
the
head
clerk
to
raskolnikov
write
what
the
latter
asked
gruffly
i
will
dictate
to
raskolnikov
fancied
that
the
head
clerk
treated
him
more
casually
and
contemptuously
after
his
speech
but
strange
to
say
he
suddenly
felt
completely
indifferent
to
anyone
s
opinion
and
this
revulsion
took
place
in
a
flash
in
one
instant
if
he
had
cared
to
think
a
little
he
would
have
been
amazed
indeed
that
he
could
have
talked
to
them
like
that
a
minute
before
forcing
his
feeling
upon
them
and
where
had
those
feeling
come
from
now
if
the
whole
room
had
been
filled
not
with
police
officer
but
with
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
he
would
not
have
found
one
human
word
for
them
so
empty
wa
his
heart
a
gloomy
sensation
of
agonising
everlasting
solitude
and
remoteness
took
conscious
form
in
his
soul
it
wa
not
the
meanness
of
his
sentimental
effusion
before
ilya
petrovitch
nor
the
meanness
of
the
latter
s
triumph
over
him
that
had
caused
this
sudden
revulsion
in
his
heart
oh
what
had
he
to
do
now
with
his
own
baseness
with
all
these
petty
vanity
officer
german
woman
debt
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
be
burnt
at
that
moment
he
would
not
have
stirred
would
hardly
have
heard
the
sentence
to
the
end
something
wa
happening
to
him
entirely
new
sudden
and
unknown
it
wa
not
that
he
understood
but
he
felt
clearly
with
all
the
intensity
of
sensation
that
he
could
never
more
appeal
to
these
people
in
the
with
sentimental
effusion
like
his
recent
outburst
or
with
anything
whatever
and
that
if
they
had
been
his
own
brother
and
sister
and
not
it
would
have
been
utterly
out
of
the
question
to
appeal
to
them
in
any
circumstance
of
life
he
had
never
experienced
such
a
strange
and
awful
sensation
and
what
wa
most
agonising
it
wa
more
a
sensation
than
a
conception
or
idea
a
direct
sensation
the
most
agonising
of
all
the
sensation
he
had
known
in
his
life
the
head
clerk
began
dictating
to
him
the
usual
form
of
declaration
that
he
could
not
pay
that
he
undertook
to
do
so
at
a
future
date
that
he
would
not
leave
the
town
nor
sell
his
property
and
so
on
but
you
can
t
write
you
can
hardly
hold
the
pen
observed
the
head
clerk
looking
with
curiosity
at
raskolnikov
are
you
ill
yes
i
am
giddy
go
on
that
s
all
sign
the
head
clerk
took
the
paper
and
turned
to
attend
to
others
raskolnikov
gave
back
the
pen
but
instead
of
getting
up
and
going
away
he
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
pressed
his
head
in
his
hand
he
felt
a
if
a
nail
were
being
driven
into
his
skull
a
strange
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
get
up
at
once
to
go
up
to
nikodim
fomitch
and
tell
him
everything
that
had
happened
yesterday
and
then
to
go
with
him
to
his
lodging
and
to
show
him
the
thing
in
the
hole
in
the
corner
the
impulse
wa
so
strong
that
he
got
up
from
his
seat
to
carry
it
out
hadn
t
i
better
think
a
minute
flashed
through
his
mind
no
better
cast
off
the
burden
without
but
all
at
once
he
stood
still
rooted
to
the
spot
nikodim
fomitch
wa
talking
eagerly
with
ilya
petrovitch
and
the
word
reached
him
it
s
impossible
they
ll
both
be
released
to
begin
with
the
whole
story
contradicts
itself
why
should
they
have
called
the
porter
if
it
had
been
their
doing
to
inform
against
themselves
or
a
a
blind
no
that
would
be
too
cunning
besides
pestryakov
the
student
wa
seen
at
the
gate
by
both
the
porter
and
a
woman
a
he
went
in
he
wa
walking
with
three
friend
who
left
him
only
at
the
gate
and
he
asked
the
porter
to
direct
him
in
the
presence
of
the
friend
now
would
he
have
asked
his
way
if
he
had
been
going
with
such
an
object
a
for
koch
he
spent
half
an
hour
at
the
silversmith
s
below
before
he
went
up
to
the
old
woman
and
he
left
him
at
exactly
a
quarter
to
eight
now
just
consider
but
excuse
me
how
do
you
explain
this
contradiction
they
state
themselves
that
they
knocked
and
the
door
wa
locked
yet
three
minute
later
when
they
went
up
with
the
porter
it
turned
out
the
door
wa
that
s
just
it
the
murderer
must
have
been
there
and
bolted
himself
in
and
they
d
have
caught
him
for
a
certainty
if
koch
had
not
been
an
as
and
gone
to
look
for
the
porter
too
must
have
seized
the
interval
to
get
downstairs
and
slip
by
them
somehow
koch
keep
crossing
himself
and
saying
if
i
had
been
there
he
would
have
jumped
out
and
killed
me
with
his
he
is
going
to
have
a
thanksgiving
service
ha
ha
and
no
one
saw
the
murderer
they
might
well
not
see
him
the
house

a
regular
noah

said
the
head
clerk
who
wa
listening
it
s
clear
quite
clear
nikodim
fomitch
repeated
warmly
no
it
is
anything
but
clear
ilya
petrovitch
maintained
raskolnikov
picked
up
his
hat
and
walked
towards
the
door
but
he
did
not
reach
it
when
he
recovered
consciousness
he
found
himself
sitting
in
a
chair
supported
by
someone
on
the
right
side
while
someone
else
wa
standing
on
the
left
holding
a
yellowish
glass
filled
with
yellow
water
and
nikodim
fomitch
standing
before
him
looking
intently
at
him
he
got
up
from
the
chair
what
s
this
are
you
ill
nikodim
fomitch
asked
rather
sharply
he
could
hardly
hold
his
pen
when
he
wa
signing
said
the
head
clerk
settling
back
in
his
place
and
taking
up
his
work
again
have
you
been
ill
long
cried
ilya
petrovitch
from
his
place
where
he
too
wa
looking
through
paper
he
had
of
course
come
to
look
at
the
sick
man
when
he
fainted
but
retired
at
once
when
he
recovered
since
yesterday
muttered
raskolnikov
in
reply
did
you
go
out
yesterday
though
you
were
ill
at
what
time
about
and
where
did
you
go
may
i
ask
along
the
short
and
raskolnikov
white
a
a
handkerchief
had
answered
sharply
jerkily
without
dropping
his
black
feverish
eye
before
ilya
petrovitch
s
stare
he
can
scarcely
stand
upright
and
you
nikodim
fomitch
wa
beginning
no
matter
ilya
petrovitch
pronounced
rather
peculiarly
nikodim
fomitch
would
have
made
some
further
protest
but
glancing
at
the
head
clerk
who
wa
looking
very
hard
at
him
he
did
not
speak
there
wa
a
sudden
silence
it
wa
strange
very
well
then
concluded
ilya
petrovitch
we
will
not
detain
raskolnikov
went
out
he
caught
the
sound
of
eager
conversation
on
his
departure
and
above
the
rest
rose
the
questioning
voice
of
nikodim
fomitch
in
the
street
his
faintness
passed
off
completely
a
search
there
will
be
a
search
at
once
he
repeated
to
himself
hurrying
home
the
brute
they
his
former
terror
mastered
him
completely
again
chapter
ii
and
what
if
there
ha
been
a
search
already
what
if
i
find
them
in
my
room
but
here
wa
his
room
nothing
and
no
one
in
it
no
one
had
peeped
in
even
nastasya
had
not
touched
it
but
heaven
how
could
he
have
left
all
those
thing
in
the
hole
he
rushed
to
the
corner
slipped
his
hand
under
the
paper
pulled
the
thing
out
and
lined
his
pocket
with
them
there
were
eight
article
in
all
two
little
box
with
or
something
of
the
sort
he
hardly
looked
to
see
then
four
small
leather
case
there
wa
a
chain
too
merely
wrapped
in
newspaper
and
something
else
in
newspaper
that
looked
like
a
decoration
he
put
them
all
in
the
different
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
the
remaining
pocket
of
his
trouser
trying
to
conceal
them
a
much
a
possible
he
took
the
purse
too
then
he
went
out
of
his
room
leaving
the
door
open
he
walked
quickly
and
resolutely
and
though
he
felt
shattered
he
had
his
sens
about
him
he
wa
afraid
of
pursuit
he
wa
afraid
that
in
another
another
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
instruction
would
be
issued
for
his
pursuit
and
so
at
all
cost
he
must
hide
all
trace
before
then
he
must
clear
everything
up
while
he
still
had
some
strength
some
reasoning
power
left
him
where
wa
he
to
go
that
had
long
been
settled
fling
them
into
the
canal
and
all
trace
hidden
in
the
water
the
thing
would
be
at
an
so
he
had
decided
in
the
night
of
his
delirium
when
several
time
he
had
had
the
impulse
to
get
up
and
go
away
to
make
haste
and
get
rid
of
it
all
but
to
get
rid
of
it
turned
out
to
be
a
very
difficult
task
he
wandered
along
the
bank
of
the
ekaterininsky
canal
for
half
an
hour
or
more
and
looked
several
time
at
the
step
running
down
to
the
water
but
he
could
not
think
of
carrying
out
his
plan
either
raft
stood
at
the
step
edge
and
woman
were
washing
clothes
on
them
or
boat
were
moored
there
and
people
were
swarming
everywhere
moreover
he
could
be
seen
and
noticed
from
the
bank
on
all
side
it
would
look
suspicious
for
a
man
to
go
down
on
purpose
stop
and
throw
something
into
the
water
and
what
if
the
box
were
to
float
instead
of
sinking
and
of
course
they
would
even
a
it
wa
everyone
he
met
seemed
to
stare
and
look
round
a
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
watch
him
why
is
it
or
can
it
be
my
fancy
he
thought
at
last
the
thought
struck
him
that
it
might
be
better
to
go
to
the
neva
there
were
not
so
many
people
there
he
would
be
less
observed
and
it
would
be
more
convenient
in
every
way
above
all
it
wa
further
off
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
wandering
for
a
good
worried
and
anxious
in
this
dangerous
past
without
thinking
of
it
before
and
that
he
had
lost
over
an
irrational
plan
simply
because
he
had
thought
of
it
in
delirium
he
had
become
extremely
absent
and
forgetful
and
he
wa
aware
of
it
he
certainly
must
make
haste
he
walked
towards
the
neva
along
v
prospect
but
on
the
way
another
idea
struck
him
why
to
the
neva
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
somewhere
far
off
to
the
island
again
and
there
hide
the
thing
in
some
solitary
place
in
a
wood
or
under
a
bush
and
mark
the
spot
perhaps
and
though
he
felt
incapable
of
clear
judgment
the
idea
seemed
to
him
a
sound
one
but
he
wa
not
destined
to
go
there
for
coming
out
of
v
prospect
towards
the
square
he
saw
on
the
left
a
passage
leading
between
two
blank
wall
to
a
courtyard
on
the
right
hand
the
blank
unwhitewashed
wall
of
a
house
stretched
far
into
the
court
on
the
left
a
wooden
hoarding
ran
parallel
with
it
for
twenty
pace
into
the
court
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
here
wa
a
deserted
place
where
rubbish
of
different
sort
wa
lying
at
the
end
of
the
court
the
corner
of
a
low
smutty
stone
shed
apparently
part
of
some
workshop
peeped
from
behind
the
hoarding
it
wa
probably
a
carriage
builder
s
or
carpenter
s
shed
the
whole
place
from
the
entrance
wa
black
with
coal
dust
here
would
be
the
place
to
throw
it
he
thought
not
seeing
anyone
in
the
yard
he
slipped
in
and
at
once
saw
near
the
gate
a
sink
such
a
is
often
put
in
yard
where
there
are
many
workman
or
and
on
the
hoarding
above
had
been
scribbled
in
chalk
the
witticism
standing
here
strictly
this
wa
all
the
better
for
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
about
his
going
in
here
i
could
throw
it
all
in
a
heap
and
get
away
looking
round
once
more
with
his
hand
already
in
his
pocket
he
noticed
against
the
outer
wall
between
the
entrance
and
the
sink
a
big
unhewn
stone
weighing
perhaps
sixty
pound
the
other
side
of
the
wall
wa
a
street
he
could
hear
always
numerous
in
that
part
but
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
entrance
unless
someone
came
in
from
the
street
which
might
well
happen
indeed
so
there
wa
need
of
haste
he
bent
down
over
the
stone
seized
the
top
of
it
firmly
in
both
hand
and
using
all
his
strength
turned
it
over
under
the
stone
wa
a
small
hollow
in
the
ground
and
he
immediately
emptied
his
pocket
into
it
the
purse
lay
at
the
top
and
yet
the
hollow
wa
not
filled
up
then
he
seized
the
stone
again
and
with
one
twist
turned
it
back
so
that
it
wa
in
the
same
position
again
though
it
stood
a
very
little
higher
but
he
scraped
the
earth
about
it
and
pressed
it
at
the
edge
with
his
foot
nothing
could
be
noticed
then
he
went
out
and
turned
into
the
square
again
an
intense
almost
unbearable
joy
overwhelmed
him
for
an
instant
a
it
had
in
the
i
have
buried
my
track
and
who
who
can
think
of
looking
under
that
stone
it
ha
been
lying
there
most
likely
ever
since
the
house
wa
built
and
will
lie
a
many
year
more
and
if
it
were
found
who
would
think
of
me
it
is
all
over
no
clue
and
he
laughed
yes
he
remembered
that
he
began
laughing
a
thin
nervous
noiseless
laugh
and
went
on
laughing
all
the
time
he
wa
crossing
the
square
but
when
he
reached
the
k
boulevard
where
two
day
before
he
had
come
upon
that
girl
his
laughter
suddenly
ceased
other
idea
crept
into
his
mind
he
felt
all
at
once
that
it
would
be
loathsome
to
pas
that
seat
on
which
after
the
girl
wa
gone
he
had
sat
and
pondered
and
that
it
would
be
hateful
too
to
meet
that
whiskered
policeman
to
whom
he
had
given
the
twenty
copeck
damn
him
he
walked
looking
about
him
angrily
and
distractedly
all
his
idea
now
seemed
to
be
circling
round
some
single
point
and
he
felt
that
there
really
wa
such
a
point
and
that
now
now
he
wa
left
facing
that
point
and
for
the
first
time
indeed
during
the
last
two
month
damn
it
all
he
thought
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
if
it
ha
begun
then
it
ha
begun
hang
the
new
life
good
lord
how
stupid
it
is
and
what
lie
i
told
how
despicably
i
fawned
upon
that
wretched
ilya
petrovitch
but
that
is
all
folly
what
do
i
care
for
them
all
and
my
fawning
upon
them
it
is
not
that
at
all
it
is
not
that
at
all
suddenly
he
stopped
a
new
utterly
unexpected
and
exceedingly
simple
question
perplexed
and
bitterly
confounded
him
if
it
all
ha
really
been
done
deliberately
and
not
idiotically
if
i
really
had
a
certain
and
definite
object
how
is
it
i
did
not
even
glance
into
the
purse
and
don
t
know
what
i
had
there
for
which
i
have
undergone
these
agony
and
have
deliberately
undertaken
this
base
filthy
degrading
business
and
here
i
wanted
at
once
to
throw
into
the
water
the
purse
together
with
all
the
thing
which
i
had
not
seen
either
how
s
that
yes
that
wa
so
that
wa
all
so
yet
he
had
known
it
all
before
and
it
wa
not
a
new
question
for
him
even
when
it
wa
decided
in
the
night
without
hesitation
and
consideration
a
though
so
it
must
be
a
though
it
could
not
possibly
be
otherwise
yes
he
had
known
it
all
and
understood
it
all
it
surely
had
all
been
settled
even
yesterday
at
the
moment
when
he
wa
bending
over
the
box
and
pulling
the
out
of
it
yes
so
it
wa
it
is
because
i
am
very
ill
he
decided
grimly
at
last
i
have
been
worrying
and
fretting
myself
and
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
doing
yesterday
and
the
day
before
yesterday
and
all
this
time
i
have
been
worrying
myself
i
shall
get
well
and
i
shall
not
worry
but
what
if
i
don
t
get
well
at
all
good
god
how
sick
i
am
of
it
all
he
walked
on
without
resting
he
had
a
terrible
longing
for
some
distraction
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
what
to
attempt
a
new
overwhelming
sensation
wa
gaining
more
and
more
mastery
over
him
every
moment
this
wa
an
immeasurable
almost
physical
repulsion
for
everything
surrounding
him
an
obstinate
malignant
feeling
of
hatred
all
who
met
him
were
loathsome
to
him
he
loathed
their
face
their
movement
their
gesture
if
anyone
had
addressed
him
he
felt
that
he
might
have
spat
at
him
or
bitten
him
he
stopped
suddenly
on
coming
out
on
the
bank
of
the
little
neva
near
the
bridge
to
vassilyevsky
ostrov
why
he
life
here
in
that
house
he
thought
why
i
have
not
come
to
razumihin
of
my
own
accord
here
it
s
the
same
thing
over
again
very
interesting
to
know
though
have
i
come
on
purpose
or
have
i
simply
walked
here
by
chance
never
mind
i
said
the
day
before
yesterday
that
i
would
go
and
see
him
the
day
well
and
so
i
will
besides
i
really
can
not
go
further
he
went
up
to
razumihin
s
room
on
the
fifth
floor
the
latter
wa
at
home
in
his
garret
busily
writing
at
the
moment
and
he
opened
the
door
himself
it
wa
four
month
since
they
had
seen
each
other
razumihin
wa
sitting
in
a
ragged
with
slipper
on
his
bare
foot
unkempt
unshaven
and
unwashed
his
face
showed
surprise
is
it
you
he
cried
he
looked
his
comrade
up
and
down
then
after
a
brief
pause
he
whistled
a
hard
up
a
all
that
why
brother
you
ve
cut
me
out
he
added
looking
at
raskolnikov
s
rag
come
sit
down
you
are
tired
i
ll
be
and
when
he
had
sunk
down
on
the
american
leather
sofa
which
wa
in
even
worse
condition
than
his
own
razumihin
saw
at
once
that
his
visitor
wa
why
you
are
seriously
ill
do
you
know
that
he
began
feeling
his
pulse
raskolnikov
pulled
away
his
hand
never
mind
he
said
i
have
come
for
this
i
have
no
lesson
i
wanted
but
i
don
t
really
want
lesson
but
i
say
you
are
delirious
you
know
razumihin
observed
watching
him
carefully
no
i
am
raskolnikov
got
up
from
the
sofa
a
he
had
mounted
the
stair
to
razumihin
s
he
had
not
realised
that
he
would
be
meeting
his
friend
face
to
face
now
in
a
flash
he
knew
that
what
he
wa
least
of
all
disposed
for
at
that
moment
wa
to
be
face
to
face
with
anyone
in
the
wide
world
his
spleen
rose
within
him
he
almost
choked
with
rage
at
himself
a
soon
a
he
crossed
razumihin
s
threshold
he
said
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
door
stop
stop
you
queer
i
don
t
want
to
said
the
other
again
pulling
away
his
hand
then
why
the
devil
have
you
come
are
you
mad
or
what
why
this
is
almost
insulting
i
won
t
let
you
go
like
well
then
i
came
to
you
because
i
know
no
one
but
you
who
could
help
to
begin
because
you
are
kinder
than
anyone
cleverer
i
mean
and
can
judge
and
now
i
see
that
i
want
nothing
do
you
hear
nothing
at
all
no
one
s
service
no
one
s
sympathy
i
am
by
myself
alone
come
that
s
enough
leave
me
stay
a
minute
you
sweep
you
are
a
perfect
madman

care
i
have
no
lesson
do
you
see
and
i
don

about
that
but
there

a
bookseller
heruvimov
and
he
take
the
place
of
a
lesson
i
would
not

kind
and
issuing

what

but
of
course
i
encourage
him
here
are
two
signature
of
the
german
text
in
my
opinion
the
crudest
charlatanism
it
discusses
the
question
is
woman
a
human
being
and
of
course
triumphantly
prof
that
she
is
heruvimov
is
going
to
bring
out
this
work
a
a
contribution

the
woman
question
i
am
translating

these
two
and
a
half
signature
into
six
we
shall
make
up
a
gorgeous
title
half
a
page
long
and
bring
it
out
at
half
a
rouble
it
will
do
he

fifteen
rouble
for
the
job
and
i
ve
had
six
already
in
advance
when
we
have
finished
this
we
are
going
to
begin
a
translation
about
whale
and
then
some
of
the
dullest
scandal
out
of
the
second
part
of
we
have
marked
for
translation
somebody
ha
told
heruvimov
that
rousseau
wa
a
kind
of
radishchev
you
may
be
sure
i
don
t
contradict
him
hang
him
well
would
you
like
to
do
the
second
signature
of
woman
a
human
being
if
you
would
take
the
german
and
pen
and
paper
all
those
are
provided
and
take
three
rouble
for
a
i
have
had
six
rouble
in
advance
on
the
whole
thing
three
rouble
come
to
you
for
your
share
and
when
you
have
finished
the
signature
there
will
be
another
three
rouble
for
you
and
please
don
t
think
i
am
doing
you
a
service
quite
the
contrary
a
soon
a
you
came
in
i
saw
how
you
could
help
me
to
begin
with
i
am
weak
in
spelling
and
secondly
i
am
sometimes
utterly
adrift
in
german
so
that
i
make
it
up
a
i
go
along
for
the
most
part
the
only
comfort
is
that
it
s
bound
to
be
a
change
for
the
better
though
who
can
tell
maybe
it
s
sometimes
for
the
worse
will
you
take
it
raskolnikov
took
the
german
sheet
in
silence
took
the
three
rouble
and
without
a
word
went
out
razumihin
gazed
after
him
in
astonishment
but
when
raskolnikov
wa
in
the
next
street
he
turned
back
mounted
the
stair
to
razumihin
s
again
and
laying
on
the
table
the
german
article
and
the
three
rouble
went
out
again
still
without
uttering
a
word
are
you
raving
or
what
razumihin
shouted
roused
to
fury
at
last
what
farce
is
this
you
ll
drive
me
crazy
too
what
did
you
come
to
see
me
for
damn
you
i
don
t
want
translation
muttered
raskolnikov
from
the
stair
then
what
the
devil
do
you
want
shouted
razumihin
from
above
raskolnikov
continued
descending
the
staircase
in
silence
hey
there
where
are
you
living
no
answer
well
confound
you
then
but
raskolnikov
wa
already
stepping
into
the
street
on
the
nikolaevsky
bridge
he
wa
roused
to
full
consciousness
again
by
an
unpleasant
incident
a
coachman
after
shouting
at
him
two
or
three
time
gave
him
a
violent
lash
on
the
back
with
his
whip
for
having
almost
fallen
under
his
horse
hoof
the
lash
so
infuriated
him
that
he
dashed
away
to
the
railing
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
been
walking
in
the
very
middle
of
the
bridge
in
the
traffic
he
angrily
clenched
and
ground
his
teeth
he
heard
laughter
of
course
serf
him
right
a
pickpocket
i
dare
pretending
to
be
drunk
for
sure
and
getting
under
the
wheel
on
purpose
and
you
have
to
answer
for
it
s
a
regular
profession
that
s
what
it
but
while
he
stood
at
the
railing
still
looking
angry
and
bewildered
after
the
retreating
carriage
and
rubbing
his
back
he
suddenly
felt
someone
thrust
money
into
his
hand
he
looked
it
wa
an
elderly
woman
in
a
kerchief
and
goatskin
shoe
with
a
girl
probably
her
daughter
wearing
a
hat
and
carrying
a
green
parasol
take
it
my
good
man
in
christ
s
he
took
it
and
they
passed
on
it
wa
a
piece
of
twenty
copeck
from
his
dress
and
appearance
they
might
well
have
taken
him
for
a
beggar
asking
alms
in
the
street
and
the
gift
of
the
twenty
copeck
he
doubtless
owed
to
the
blow
which
made
them
feel
sorry
for
him
he
closed
his
hand
on
the
twenty
copeck
walked
on
for
ten
pace
and
turned
facing
the
neva
looking
towards
the
palace
the
sky
wa
without
a
cloud
and
the
water
wa
almost
bright
blue
which
is
so
rare
in
the
neva
the
cupola
of
the
cathedral
which
is
seen
at
it
best
from
the
bridge
about
twenty
pace
from
the
chapel
glittered
in
the
sunlight
and
in
the
pure
air
every
ornament
on
it
could
be
clearly
distinguished
the
pain
from
the
lash
went
off
and
raskolnikov
forgot
about
it
one
uneasy
and
not
quite
definite
idea
occupied
him
now
completely
he
stood
still
and
gazed
long
and
intently
into
the
distance
this
spot
wa
especially
familiar
to
him
when
he
wa
attending
the
university
he
had
hundred
of
time
generally
on
his
way
home
stood
still
on
this
spot
gazed
at
this
truly
magnificent
spectacle
and
almost
always
marvelled
at
a
vague
and
mysterious
emotion
it
roused
in
him
it
left
him
strangely
cold
this
gorgeous
picture
wa
for
him
blank
and
lifeless
he
wondered
every
time
at
his
sombre
and
enigmatic
impression
and
mistrusting
himself
put
off
finding
the
explanation
of
it
he
vividly
recalled
those
old
doubt
and
perplexity
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
wa
no
mere
chance
that
he
recalled
them
now
it
struck
him
a
strange
and
grotesque
that
he
should
have
stopped
at
the
same
spot
a
before
a
though
he
actually
imagined
he
could
think
the
same
thought
be
interested
in
the
same
theory
and
picture
that
had
interested
him
so
short
a
time
ago
he
felt
it
almost
amusing
and
yet
it
wrung
his
heart
deep
down
hidden
far
away
out
of
sight
all
that
seemed
to
him
now
all
his
old
past
his
old
thought
his
old
problem
and
theory
his
old
impression
and
that
picture
and
himself
and
all
all
he
felt
a
though
he
were
flying
upwards
and
everything
were
vanishing
from
his
sight
making
an
unconscious
movement
with
his
hand
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
piece
of
money
in
his
fist
he
opened
his
hand
stared
at
the
coin
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
flung
it
into
the
water
then
he
turned
and
went
home
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
everyone
and
from
everything
at
that
moment
evening
wa
coming
on
when
he
reached
home
so
that
he
must
have
been
walking
about
six
hour
how
and
where
he
came
back
he
did
not
remember
undressing
and
quivering
like
an
overdriven
horse
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
drew
his
greatcoat
over
him
and
at
once
sank
into
oblivion
it
wa
dusk
when
he
wa
waked
up
by
a
fearful
scream
good
god
what
a
scream
such
unnatural
sound
such
howling
wailing
grinding
tear
blow
and
curse
he
had
never
heard
he
could
never
have
imagined
such
brutality
such
frenzy
in
terror
he
sat
up
in
bed
almost
swooning
with
agony
but
the
fighting
wailing
and
cursing
grew
louder
and
louder
and
then
to
his
intense
amazement
he
caught
the
voice
of
his
landlady
she
wa
howling
shrieking
and
wailing
rapidly
hurriedly
incoherently
so
that
he
could
not
make
out
what
she
wa
talking
about
she
wa
beseeching
no
doubt
not
to
be
beaten
for
she
wa
being
mercilessly
beaten
on
the
stair
the
voice
of
her
assailant
wa
so
horrible
from
spite
and
rage
that
it
wa
almost
a
croak
but
he
too
wa
saying
something
and
just
a
quickly
and
indistinctly
hurrying
and
spluttering
all
at
once
raskolnikov
trembled
he
recognised
the
voice
it
wa
the
voice
of
ilya
petrovitch
ilya
petrovitch
here
and
beating
the
landlady
he
is
kicking
her
banging
her
head
against
the
step
that
s
clear
that
can
be
told
from
the
sound
from
the
cry
and
the
thud
how
is
it
is
the
world
he
could
hear
people
running
in
crowd
from
all
the
storey
and
all
the
staircase
he
heard
voice
exclamation
knocking
door
banging
but
why
why
and
how
could
it
be
he
repeated
thinking
seriously
that
he
had
gone
mad
but
no
he
heard
too
distinctly
and
they
would
come
to
him
then
next
for
no
doubt
it
s
all
about
that
about
yesterday
good
god
he
would
have
fastened
his
door
with
the
latch
but
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
besides
it
would
be
useless
terror
gripped
his
heart
like
ice
tortured
him
and
numbed
him
but
at
last
all
this
uproar
after
continuing
about
ten
minute
began
gradually
to
subside
the
landlady
wa
moaning
and
groaning
ilya
petrovitch
wa
still
uttering
threat
and
curse
but
at
last
he
too
seemed
to
be
silent
and
now
he
could
not
be
heard
can
he
have
gone
away
good
lord
yes
and
now
the
landlady
is
going
too
still
weeping
and
moaning
and
then
her
door
slammed
now
the
crowd
wa
going
from
the
stair
to
their
room
exclaiming
disputing
calling
to
one
another
raising
their
voice
to
a
shout
dropping
them
to
a
whisper
there
must
have
been
number
of
them
almost
all
the
inmate
of
the
block
but
good
god
how
could
it
be
and
why
why
had
he
come
here
raskolnikov
sank
worn
out
on
the
sofa
but
could
not
close
his
eye
he
lay
for
half
an
hour
in
such
anguish
such
an
intolerable
sensation
of
infinite
terror
a
he
had
never
experienced
before
suddenly
a
bright
light
flashed
into
his
room
nastasya
came
in
with
a
candle
and
a
plate
of
soup
looking
at
him
carefully
and
ascertaining
that
he
wa
not
asleep
she
set
the
candle
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
out
what
she
had
brought
bread
salt
a
plate
a
spoon
you
ve
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
i
warrant
you
ve
been
trudging
about
all
day
and
you
re
shaking
with
nastasya
what
were
they
beating
the
landlady
for
she
looked
intently
at
him
who
beat
the
landlady
just
now
half
an
hour
ago
ilya
petrovitch
the
assistant
superintendent
on
the
stair
why
wa
he
her
like
that
and
why
wa
he
here
nastasya
scrutinised
him
silent
and
frowning
and
her
scrutiny
lasted
a
long
time
he
felt
uneasy
even
frightened
at
her
searching
eye
nastasya
why
don
t
you
speak
he
said
timidly
at
last
in
a
weak
voice
it
s
the
blood
she
answered
at
last
softly
a
though
speaking
to
herself
blood
what
blood
he
muttered
growing
white
and
turning
towards
the
wall
nastasya
still
looked
at
him
without
speaking
nobody
ha
been
beating
the
landlady
she
declared
at
last
in
a
firm
resolute
voice
he
gazed
at
her
hardly
able
to
breathe
i
heard
it
myself
i
wa
not
asleep
i
wa
sitting
up
he
said
still
more
timidly
i
listened
a
long
while
the
assistant
superintendent
came
everyone
ran
out
on
to
the
stair
from
all
the
no
one
ha
been
here
that
s
the
blood
cry
in
your
ear
when
there
s
no
outlet
for
it
and
it
get
clotted
you
begin
fancying
thing
will
you
eat
something
he
made
no
answer
nastasya
still
stood
over
him
watching
him
give
me
something
to
drink
she
went
downstairs
and
returned
with
a
white
earthenware
jug
of
water
he
remembered
only
swallowing
one
sip
of
the
cold
water
and
spilling
some
on
his
neck
then
followed
forgetfulness
chapter
iii
he
wa
not
completely
unconscious
however
all
the
time
he
wa
ill
he
wa
in
a
feverish
state
sometimes
delirious
sometimes
half
conscious
he
remembered
a
great
deal
afterwards
sometimes
it
seemed
a
though
there
were
a
number
of
people
round
him
they
wanted
to
take
him
away
somewhere
there
wa
a
great
deal
of
squabbling
and
discussing
about
him
then
he
would
be
alone
in
the
room
they
had
all
gone
away
afraid
of
him
and
only
now
and
then
opened
the
door
a
crack
to
look
at
him
they
threatened
him
plotted
something
together
laughed
and
mocked
at
him
he
remembered
nastasya
often
at
his
bedside
he
distinguished
another
person
too
whom
he
seemed
to
know
very
well
though
he
could
not
remember
who
he
wa
and
this
fretted
him
even
made
him
cry
sometimes
he
fancied
he
had
been
lying
there
a
month
at
other
time
it
all
seemed
part
of
the
same
day
but
of
of
he
had
no
recollection
and
yet
every
minute
he
felt
that
he
had
forgotten
something
he
ought
to
remember
he
worried
and
tormented
himself
trying
to
remember
moaned
flew
into
a
rage
or
sank
into
awful
intolerable
terror
then
he
struggled
to
get
up
would
have
run
away
but
someone
always
prevented
him
by
force
and
he
sank
back
into
impotence
and
forgetfulness
at
last
he
returned
to
complete
consciousness
it
happened
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
fine
day
the
sun
shone
into
the
room
at
that
hour
throwing
a
streak
of
light
on
the
right
wall
and
the
corner
near
the
door
nastasya
wa
standing
beside
him
with
another
person
a
complete
stranger
who
wa
looking
at
him
very
inquisitively
he
wa
a
young
man
with
a
beard
wearing
a
full
coat
and
looked
like
a
messenger
the
landlady
wa
peeping
in
at
the
door
raskolnikov
sat
up
who
is
this
nastasya
he
asked
pointing
to
the
young
man
i
say
he
s
himself
again
she
said
he
is
himself
echoed
the
man
concluding
that
he
had
returned
to
his
sens
the
landlady
closed
the
door
and
disappeared
she
wa
always
shy
and
dreaded
conversation
or
discussion
she
wa
a
woman
of
forty
not
at
all
fat
and
buxom
with
black
eye
and
eyebrow
from
fatness
and
laziness
and
absurdly
bashful
who

he
went
on
addressing
the
man
but
at
that
moment
the
door
wa
flung
open
and
stooping
a
little

a
dull
unreasoning
terror
he
made
up
his

what
would
happen

believe
i
am
not
wandering
i
believe
it

reality
he
thought
in
a
couple
of
minute
nastasya
returned
with
the
soup
and
announced
that
the
tea
would
be
ready
directly
with
the
soup
she
brought
two
spoon
two
plate
salt
pepper
mustard
for
the
beef
and
so
on
the
table
wa
set

not
been
for
a
long
time
the
cloth

clean

would
not
be
amiss
nastasya
if
praskovya
pavlovna
were
to
send
u
up
a
couple
of
bottle
of
beer
we
could
empty
well
you
are
a
cool
hand
muttered
nastasya
and
she
departed
to
carry
out
his
order
raskolnikov
still
gazed
wildly
with
strained
attention
meanwhile
razumihin
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
him
a
clumsily
a
a
bear
put
his
left
arm
round
raskolnikov
s
head
although
he
wa
able
to
sit
up
and
with
his
right
hand
gave
him
a
spoonful
of
soup
blowing
on
it
that
it
might
not
burn
him
but
the
soup
wa
only
just
warm
raskolnikov
swallowed
one
spoonful
greedily
then
a
second
then
a
third
but
after
giving
him
a
few
more
spoonful
of
soup
razumihin
suddenly
stopped
and
said
that
he
must
ask
zossimov
whether
he
ought
to
have
more
nastasya
came
in
with
two
bottle
of
beer
and
will
you
have
tea
cut
along
nastasya
and
bring
some
tea
for
tea
we
may
venture
on
without
the
faculty
but
here
is
the
beer
he
moved
back
to
his
chair
pulled
the
soup
and
meat
in
front
of
him
and
began
eating
a
though
he
had
not
touched
food
for
three
day
i
must
tell
you
rodya
i
dine
like
this
here
every
day
now
he
mumbled
with
his
mouth
full
of
beef
and
it
s
all
pashenka
your
dear
little
landlady
who
see
to
that
she
love
to
do
anything
for
me
i
don
t
ask
for
it
but
of
course
i
don
t
object
and
here
s
nastasya
with
the
tea
she
is
a
quick
girl
nastasya
my
dear
won
t
you
have
some
beer
get
along
with
your
nonsense
a
cup
of
tea
then
a
cup
of
tea
pour
it
out
stay
i
ll
pour
it
out
myself
sit
he
poured
out
two
cup
left
his
dinner
and
sat
on
the
sofa
again
a
before
he
put
his
left
arm
round
the
sick
man
s
head
raised
him
up
and
gave
him
tea
in
spoonful
again
blowing
each
spoonful
steadily
and
earnestly
a
though
this
process
wa
the
principal
and
most
effective
mean
towards
his
friend
s
recovery
raskolnikov
said
nothing
and
made
no
resistance
though
he
felt
quite
strong
enough
to
sit
up
on
the
sofa
without
support
and
could
not
merely
have
held
a
cup
or
a
spoon
but
even
perhaps
could
have
walked
about
but
from
some
queer
almost
animal
cunning
he
conceived
the
idea
of
hiding
his
strength
and
lying
low
for
a
time
pretending
if
necessary
not
to
be
yet
in
full
possession
of
his
faculty
and
meanwhile
listening
to
find
out
what
wa
going
on
yet
he
could
not
overcome
his
sense
of
repugnance
after
sipping
a
dozen
spoonful
of
tea
he
suddenly
released
his
head
pushed
the
spoon
away
capriciously
and
sank
back
on
the
pillow
there
were
actually
real
pillow
under
his
head
now
down
pillow
in
clean
case
he
observed
that
too
and
took
note
of
it
pashenka
must
give
u
some
raspberry
jam
to
make
him
some
raspberry
tea
said
razumihin
going
back
to
his
chair
and
attacking
his
soup
and
beer
again
and
where
is
she
to
get
raspberry
for
you
asked
nastasya
balancing
a
saucer
on
her
five
outspread
finger
and
sipping
tea
through
a
lump
of
sugar
she
ll
get
it
at
the
shop
my
dear
you
see
rodya
all
sort
of
thing
have
been
happening
while
you
have
been
laid
up
when
you
decamped
in
that
rascally
way
without
leaving
your
address
i
felt
so
angry
that
i
resolved
to
find
you
out
and
punish
you
i
set
to
work
that
very
day
how
i
ran
about
making
inquiry
for
you
this
lodging
of
yours
i
had
forgotten
though
i
never
remembered
it
indeed
because
i
did
not
know
it
and
a
for
your
old
lodging
i
could
only
remember
it
wa
at
the
five
corner
harlamov
s
house
i
kept
trying
to
find
that
harlamov
s
house
and
afterwards
it
turned
out
that
it
wa
not
harlamov
s
but
buch
s
how
one
muddle
up
sound
sometimes
so
i
lost
my
temper
and
i
went
on
the
chance
to
the
address
bureau
next
day
and
only
fancy
in
two
minute
they
looked
you
up
your
name
is
down
my
name
i
should
think
so
and
yet
a
general
kobelev
they
could
not
find
while
i
wa
there
well
it
s
a
long
story
but
a
soon
a
i
did
land
on
this
place
i
soon
got
to
know
all
your
affair
all
all
brother
i
know
everything
nastasya
here
will
tell
you
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
nikodim
fomitch
and
ilya
petrovitch
and
the
and
zametov
alexandr
grigorievitch
the
head
clerk
in
the
police
office
and
last
but
not
least
of
pashenka
nastasya
here
know
he
s
got
round
her
nastasya
murmured
smiling
slyly
why
don
t
you
put
the
sugar
in
your
tea
nastasya
nikiforovna
you
are
a
one
nastasya
cried
suddenly
going
off
into
a
giggle
i
am
not
nikiforovna
but
petrovna
she
added
suddenly
recovering
from
her
mirth
i
ll
make
a
note
of
it
well
brother
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
wa
going
in
for
a
regular
explosion
here
to
uproot
all
malignant
influence
in
the
locality
but
pashenka
won
the
day
i
had
not
expected
brother
to
find
her
so
prepossessing
eh
what
do
you
think
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
but
he
still
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
him
full
of
alarm
and
all
that
could
be
wished
indeed
in
every
respect
razumihin
went
on
not
at
all
embarrassed
by
his
silence
ah
the
sly
dog
nastasya
shrieked
again
this
conversation
afforded
her
unspeakable
delight
it
s
a
pity
brother
that
you
did
not
set
to
work
in
the
right
way
at
first
you
ought
to
have
approached
her
differently
she
is
so
to
speak
a
most
unaccountable
character
but
we
will
talk
about
her
character
later
how
could
you
let
thing
come
to
such
a
pas
that
she
gave
up
sending
you
your
dinner
and
that
i
o
u
you
must
have
been
mad
to
sign
an
i
o
u
and
that
promise
of
marriage
when
her
daughter
natalya
yegorovna
wa
alive
i
know
all
about
it
but
i
see
that
s
a
delicate
matter
and
i
am
an
as
forgive
me
but
talking
of
foolishness
do
you
know
praskovya
pavlovna
is
not
nearly
so
foolish
a
you
would
think
at
first
sight
no
mumbled
raskolnikov
looking
away
but
feeling
that
it
wa
better
to
keep
up
the
conversation
she
isn
t
is
she
cried
razumihin
delighted
to
get
an
answer
out
of
him
but
she
is
not
very
clever
either
eh
she
is
essentially
essentially
an
unaccountable
character
i
am
sometimes
quite
at
a
loss
i
assure
you
she
must
be
forty
she
say
she
is
and
of
course
she
ha
every
right
to
say
so
but
i
swear
i
judge
her
intellectually
simply
from
the
metaphysical
point
of
view
there
is
a
sort
of
symbolism
sprung
up
between
u
a
sort
of
algebra
or
what
not
i
don
t
understand
it
well
that
s
all
nonsense
only
seeing
that
you
are
not
a
student
now
and
have
lost
your
lesson
and
your
clothes
and
that
through
the
young
lady
s
death
she
ha
no
need
to
treat
you
a
a
relation
she
suddenly
took
fright
and
a
you
hid
in
your
den
and
dropped
all
your
old
relation
with
her
she
planned
to
get
rid
of
you
and
she
s
been
cherishing
that
design
a
long
time
but
wa
sorry
to
lose
the
i
o
u
for
you
assured
her
yourself
that
your
mother
would
it
wa
base
of
me
to
say
that
my
mother
herself
is
almost
a
beggar
and
i
told
a
lie
to
keep
my
lodging
and
be
fed
raskolnikov
said
loudly
and
distinctly
yes
you
did
very
sensibly
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
at
that
point
tchebarov
turn
up
a
business
man
pashenka
would
never
have
thought
of
doing
anything
on
her
own
account
she
is
too
retiring
but
the
business
man
is
by
no
mean
retiring
and
first
thing
he
put
the
question
is
there
any
hope
of
realising
the
i
o
u
answer
there
is
because
he
ha
a
mother
who
would
save
her
rodya
with
her
hundred
and
rouble
pension
if
she
ha
to
starve
herself
and
a
sister
too
who
would
go
into
bondage
for
his
sake
that
s
what
he
wa
building
upon
why
do
you
start
i
know
all
the
in
and
out
of
your
affair
now
my
dear
boy
it
s
not
for
nothing
that
you
were
so
open
with
pashenka
when
you
were
her
prospective
and
i
say
all
this
a
a
friend
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
an
honest
and
sensitive
man
is
open
and
a
business
man
listens
and
go
on
eating
you
up
well
then
she
gave
the
i
o
u
by
way
of
payment
to
this
tchebarov
and
without
hesitation
he
made
a
formal
demand
for
payment
when
i
heard
of
all
this
i
wanted
to
blow
him
up
too
to
clear
my
conscience
but
by
that
time
harmony
reigned
between
me
and
pashenka
and
i
insisted
on
stopping
the
whole
affair
engaging
that
you
would
pay
i
went
security
for
you
brother
do
you
understand
we
called
tchebarov
flung
him
ten
rouble
and
got
the
i
o
u
back
from
him
and
here
i
have
the
honour
of
presenting
it
to
you
she
trust
your
word
now
here
take
it
you
see
i
have
torn
razumihin
put
the
note
on
the
table
raskolnikov
looked
at
him
and
turned
to
the
wall
without
uttering
a
word
even
razumihin
felt
a
twinge
i
see
brother
he
said
a
moment
later
that
i
have
been
playing
the
fool
again
i
thought
i
should
amuse
you
with
my
chatter
and
i
believe
i
have
only
made
you
wa
it
you
i
did
not
recognise
when
i
wa
delirious
raskolnikov
asked
after
a
moment
s
pause
without
turning
his
head
yes
and
you
flew
into
a
rage
about
it
especially
when
i
brought
zametov
one
zametov
the
head
clerk
what
for
raskolnikov
turned
round
quickly
and
fixed
his
eye
on
razumihin
what
s
the
matter
with
you
what
are
you
upset
about
he
wanted
to
make
your
acquaintance
because
i
talked
to
him
a
lot
about
you
how
could
i
have
found
out
so
much
except
from
him
he
is
a
capital
fellow
brother
in
his
own
way
of
course
now
we
are
friend

each
other
almost
every
day
i
have
moved
into
this
part

i
have
only
just
moved
i
ve
been
with
him
to
luise
ivanovna
once
or
twice
do
you
remember
luise

i
say
anything
in
delirium

rave
about

rave
about
what
people

about
well
brother
now
i
must
not
lose
time
to
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
took
up
his
cap
what
did
i
rave
about
how
he

of
having
let
out
some
secret

countess
but

lot

bulldog
and
about
and
chain
and
about
krestovsky
island
and
some
porter
and
nikodim
fomitch
and
ilya
petrovitch

assistant
superintendent
and
another
thing

of
special
interest
to
you

own
sock

me
my
zametov
hunted
all
about
your
room
for
your
sock
and
with
his
own
scented
finger
he
gave
you
the
rag
and
only
then
were
you
comforted
and
for
the
next
hour
you
held
the
wretched
thing
in
your
hand
we
could
not
get
it
from
you
it
is
most
likely
somewhere
under
your
quilt
at
this
moment
and
then
you
asked
so
piteously
for
fringe
for
your
trouser
we
tried
to
find
out
what
sort
of
fringe
but
we
could
not
make
it
out
now
to
business
here
are
rouble
i
take
ten
of
them
and
shall
give
you
an
account
of
them
in
an
hour
or
two
i
will
let
zossimov
know
at
the
same
time
though
he
ought
to
have
been
here
long
ago
for
it
is
nearly
twelve
and
you
nastasya
look
in
pretty
often
while
i
am
away
to
see
whether
he
want
a
drink
or
anything
else
and
i
will
tell
pashenka
what
is
wanted
myself
he
call
her
pashenka
ah
he
s
a
deep
one
said
nastasya
a
he
went
out
then
she
opened
the
door
and
stood
listening
but
could
not
resist
running
downstairs
after
him
she
wa
very
eager
to
hear
what
he
would
say
to
the
landlady
she
wa
evidently
quite
fascinated
by
razumihin
no
sooner
had
she
left
the
room
than
the
sick
man
flung
off
the
bedclothes
and
leapt
out
of
bed
like
a
madman
with
burning
twitching
impatience
he
had
waited
for
them
to
be
gone
so
that
he
might
set
to
work
but
to
what
work
now
a
though
to
spite
him
it
eluded
him
good
god
only
tell
me
one
thing
do
they
know
of
it
yet
or
not
what
if
they
know
it
and
are
only
pretending
mocking
me
while
i
am
laid
up
and
then
they
will
come
in
and
tell
me
that
it
s
been
discovered
long
ago
and
that
they
have
only
what
am
i
to
do
now
that
s
what
i
ve
forgotten
a
though
on
purpose
forgotten
it
all
at
once
i
remembered
a
minute
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
gazed
in
miserable
bewilderment
about
him
he
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
listened
but
that
wa
not
what
he
wanted
suddenly
a
though
recalling
something
he
rushed
to
the
corner
where
there
wa
a
hole
under
the
paper
began
examining
it
put
his
hand
into
the
hole
fumbled
but
that
wa
not
it
he
went
to
the
stove
opened
it
and
began
rummaging
in
the
ash
the
frayed
edge
of
his
trouser
and
the
rag
cut
off
his
pocket
were
lying
there
just
a
he
had
thrown
them
no
one
had
looked
then
then
he
remembered
the
sock
about
which
razumihin
had
just
been
telling
him
yes
there
it
lay
on
the
sofa
under
the
quilt
but
it
wa
so
covered
with
dust
and
grime
that
zametov
could
not
have
seen
anything
on
it
bah
zametov
the
police
office
and
why
am
i
sent
for
to
the
police
office
where
s
the
notice
bah
i
am
mixing
it
up
that
wa
then
i
looked
at
my
sock
then
too
but
now
now
i
have
been
ill
but
what
did
zametov
come
for
why
did
razumihin
bring
him
he
muttered
helplessly
sitting
on
the
sofa
again
what
doe
it
mean
am
i
still
in
delirium
or
is
it
real
i
believe
it
is
real
ah
i
remember
i
must
escape
make
haste
to
escape
yes
i
must
i
must
escape
yes
but
where
and
where
are
my
clothes
i
ve
no
boot
they
ve
taken
them
away
they
ve
hidden
them
i
understand
ah
here
is
my
coat
they
passed
that
over
and
here
is
money
on
the
table
thank
god
and
here
s
the
i
o
u
i
ll
take
the
money
and
go
and
take
another
lodging
they
won
t
find
me
yes
but
the
address
bureau
they
ll
find
me
razumihin
will
find
me
better
escape
altogether
far
away
to
america
and
let
them
do
their
worst
and
take
the
i
o
u
it
would
be
of
use
there
what
else
shall
i
take
they
think
i
am
ill
they
don
t
know
that
i
can
walk
i
could
see
by
their
eye
that
they
know
all
about
it
if
only
i
could
get
downstairs
and
what
if
they
have
set
a
watch
there
policeman
what
s
this
tea
ah
and
here
is
beer
left
half
a
bottle
cold
he
snatched
up
the
bottle
which
still
contained
a
glassful
of
beer
and
gulped
it
down
with
relish
a
though
quenching
a
flame
in
his
breast
but
in
another
minute
the
beer
had
gone
to
his
head
and
a
faint
and
even
pleasant
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
he
lay
down
and
pulled
the
quilt
over
him
his
sick
and
incoherent
thought
grew
more
and
more
disconnected
and
soon
a
light
pleasant
drowsiness
came
upon
him
with
a
sense
of
comfort
he
nestled
his
head
into
the
pillow
wrapped
more
closely
about
him
the
soft
wadded
quilt
which
had
replaced
the
old
ragged
greatcoat
sighed
softly
and
sank
into
a
deep
sound
refreshing
sleep
he
woke
up
hearing
someone
come
in
he
opened
his
eye
and
saw
razumihin
standing
in
the
doorway
uncertain
whether
to
come
in
or
not
raskolnikov
sat
up
quickly
on
the
sofa
and
gazed
at
him
a
though
trying
to
recall
something
ah
you
are
not
asleep
here
i
am
nastasya
bring
in
the
parcel

shouted
down
the
stair

shall
have
the
account

time

raskolnikov
looking
round
uneasily

hurry

tryst

all
time
before

i
ve
been
waiting
for
the
last
three
hour
for
you
i
ve
been
up
twice
and
found
you
asleep
i
ve
called
on
zossimov
twice
not
at
home
only
fancy
but
no
matter
he
will
turn
up
and
i
ve
been
out
on
my
own
business
too
you
know
i
ve
been
moving
moving
with
my
uncle
i
have
an
uncle
living
with
me

but
that

parcel
nastasya

here
why
i
told
you
all
about
it
this
morning
don
t
you
remember
raskolnikov
pondered
the
morning
seemed
like
a
dream
to
him
he
could
not
remember
alone
and
looked
inquiringly
at
razumihin
hm
said
the
latter
he
ha
forgotten
i
fancied
then
that
you
were
not
quite
yourself
now
you
are
better
for
your
sleep
you
really
look
much
better
well
to
business
look
here
my
dear
he
began
untying
the
bundle
which
evidently
interested
him
believe
me
brother
this
is
something
specially
near
my
heart
for
we
must
make
a
man
of
you
let
s
begin
from
the
top
do
you
see
this
cap
he
said
taking
out
of
the
bundle
a
fairly
good
though
cheap
and
ordinary
cap
let
me
try
it
presently
afterwards
said
raskolnikov
waving
it
off
pettishly
come
rodya
my
boy
don
t
oppose
it
afterwards
will
be
too
late
and
i
shan
t
sleep
all
night
for
i
bought
it
by
guess
without
measure
just
right
he
cried
triumphantly
fitting
it
on
just
your
size
a
proper
is
the
first
thing
in
dress
and
a
recommendation
in
it
own
way
tolstyakov
a
friend
of
mine
is
always
obliged
to
take
off
his
pudding
basin
when
he
go
into
any
public
place
where
other
people
wear
their
hat
or
cap
people
think
he
doe
it
from
slavish
politeness
but
it
s
simply
because
he
is
ashamed
of
his
bird
s
nest
he
is
such
a
boastful
fellow
look
nastasya
here
are
two
specimen
of
headgear
this
palmerston
he
took
from
the
corner
raskolnikov
s
old
battered
hat
which
for
some
unknown
reason
he
called
a
palmerston
or
this
jewel
guess
the
price
rodya
what
do
you
suppose
i
paid
for
it
nastasya
he
said
turning
to
her
seeing
that
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
twenty
copeck
no
more
i
dare
say
answered
nastasya
twenty
copeck
silly
he
cried
offended
why
nowadays
you
would
cost
more
than
that
eighty
copeck
and
that
only
because
it
ha
been
worn
and
it
s
bought
on
condition
that
when
s
it
s
worn
out
they
will
give
you
another
next
year
yes
on
my
word
well
now
let
u
pas
to
the
united
state
of
america
a
they
called
them
at
school
i
assure
you
i
am
proud
of
these
breech
and
he
exhibited
to
raskolnikov
a
pair
of
light
summer
trouser
of
grey
woollen
material
no
hole
no
spot
and
quite
respectable
although
a
little
worn
and
a
waistcoat
to
match
quite
in
the
fashion
and
it
being
worn
really
is
an
improvement
it
s
softer
smoother
you
see
rodya
to
my
thinking
the
great
thing
for
getting
on
in
the
world
is
always
to
keep
to
the
season
if
you
don
t
insist
on
having
asparagus
in
january
you
keep
your
money
in
your
purse
and
it
s
the
same
with
this
purchase
it
s
summer
now
so
i
ve
been
buying
summer
thing
warmer
material
will
be
wanted
for
autumn
so
you
will
have
to
throw
these
away
in
any
case
especially
a
they
will
be
done
for
by
then
from
their
own
lack
of
coherence
if
not
your
higher
standard
of
luxury
come
price
them
what
do
you
say
two
rouble
copeck
and
remember
the
condition
if
you
wear
these
out
you
will
have
another
suit
for
nothing
they
only
do
business
on
that
system
at
fedyaev
s
if
you
ve
bought
a
thing
once
you
are
satisfied
for
life
for
you
will
never
go
there
again
of
your
own
free
will
now
for
the

he
wa
very
short
of
cash

rouble

a
half

bargain
but
perhaps
they
won
t
fit
observed
nastasya
not
fit
just
look
and
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
raskolnikov

old
broken
boot
stiffly
coated
with
dry

trudging
around
for
nothing
razumihin
insisted
nastasya
don
t
be
bashful
but
help
me
that
s
it
and
in
spite
of
raskolnikov
s
resistance
he
changed
his
linen
the
latter
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
for
a
minute
or
two
said
nothing
it
will
be
long
before
i
get
rid
of
them
he
thought
what
money
wa
all
that
bought
with
he
asked
at
last
gazing
at
the
wall
money

your
own
what
the
messenger
brought
from
vahrushin
your
mother
sent

have
you
forgotten
that
too
i
remember
now
said
raskolnikov
after
a
long
sullen
silence
razumihin
looked
at
him
frowning
and
uneasy
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
stout
man
whose
appearance
seemed
familiar
to
raskolnikov
came
in
chapter
iv
zossimov
wa
a
tall
fat
man
with
a
puffy
colourless
face
and
straight
flaxen
hair
he
wore
spectacle
and
a
big
gold
ring
on
his
fat
finger
he
wa
he
had
on
a
light
grey
fashionable
loose
coat
light
summer
trouser
and
everything
about
him
loose
fashionable
and
spick
and
span
his
linen
wa
irreproachable
his
wa
massive
in
manner
he
wa
slow
and
a
it
were
nonchalant
and
at
the
same
time
studiously
free
and
easy
he
made
effort
to
conceal
his
but
it
wa
apparent
at
every
instant
all
his
acquaintance
found
him
tedious
but
said
he
wa
clever
at
his
work
i
ve
been
to
you
twice
brother
you
see
he
s
come
to
himself
cried
razumihin
i
see
i
see
and
how
do
we
feel
now
eh
said
zossimov
to
raskolnikov
watching
him
carefully
and
sitting
down
at
the
foot
of
the
sofa
he
settled
himself
a
comfortably
a
he
could
he
is
still
depressed
razumihin
went
on
we
ve
just
changed
his
linen
and
he
almost
that
s
very
natural
you
might
have
put
it
off
if
he
did
not
wish
it
his
pulse
is
is
your
head
still
aching
eh
i
am
well
i
am
perfectly
well
raskolnikov
declared
positively
and
irritably
he
raised
himself
on
the
sofa
and
looked
at
them
with
glittering
eye
but
sank
back
on
to
the
pillow
at
once
and
turned
to
the
wall
zossimov
watched
him
intently
very
good
going
on
all
right
he
said
lazily
ha
he
eaten
anything
they
told
him
and
asked
what
he
might
have
he
may
have
anything
soup
tea
mushroom
and
cucumber
of
course
you
must
not
give
him
he
d
better
not
have
meat
either
and
but
no
need
to
tell
you
that
razumihin
and
he
looked
at
each
other
no
more
medicine
or
anything
i
ll
look
at
him
again
perhaps
even
but
never
mind
evening
i
shall
take
him
for
a
walk
said
razumihin
we
are
going
to
the
yusupov
garden
and
then
to
the
palais
de
i
would
not
disturb
him
at
all
but
i
don
t
know
a
little
maybe
but
we
ll
ach
what
a
nuisance
i
ve
got
a
party
it
s
only
a
step
from
here
couldn
t
he
come
he
could
lie
on
the
sofa
you
are
coming
razumihin
said
to
zossimov
don
t
forget
you
all
right
only
rather
later
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
nothing
tea
vodka
herring
there
will
be
a
pie
just
our
and

except
my
old
uncle

he
only
arrived
in
petersburg
yesterday
to
see

some
business
of
his
we
meet
once
in
five
what
is
he
he
s
been
stagnating
all
his
life
a
a
district
postmaster
get
a
little
pension
he
is
not
worth
talking
about
but
i
am
fond
of
him
porfiry
petrovitch
the
head
of
the
investigation
department
here
but
you
know
is
he
a
relation
of
yours
too
a
very
distant
one
but
why
are
you
scowling
because
you
quarrelled
once
won
t
you
come
then
i
don
t
care
a
damn
for
so
much
the
better
well
there
will
be
some
student
a
teacher
a
government
clerk
a
musician
an
officer
and
do
tell
me
please
what
you
or
he
zossimov
nodded
at
raskolnikov
can
have
in
common
with
this
zametov
oh
you
particular
gentleman
principle
you
are
worked
by
principle
a
it
were
by
spring
you
won
t
venture
to
turn
round
on
your
own
account
if
a
man
is
a
nice
fellow
that
s
the
only
principle
i
go
upon
zametov
is
a
delightful
though
he
doe
take
well
he
doe
and
what
of
it
i
don
t
care
if
he
doe
take
bribe
razumihin
cried
with
unnatural
irritability
i
don
t
praise
him
for
taking
bribe
i
only
say
he
is
a
nice
man
in
his
own
way
but
if
one
look
at
men
in
all
way
are
there
many
good
one
left
why
i
am
sure
i
shouldn
t
be
worth
a
baked
onion
myself
perhaps
with
you
thrown
that
s
too
little
i
d
give
two
for
and
i
wouldn
t
give
more
than
one
for
you
no
more
of
your
joke
zametov
is
no
more
than
a
boy
i
can
pull
his
hair
and
one
must
draw
him
not
repel
him
you
ll
never
improve
a
man
by
repelling
him
especially
a
boy
one
ha
to
be
twice
a
careful
with
a
boy
oh
you
progressive
dullard
you
don
t
understand
you
harm
yourselves
running
another
man
down
but
if
you
want
to
know
we
really
have
something
in
i
should
like
to
know
why
it
s
all
about
a
we
are
getting
him
out
of
a
mess
though
indeed
there
s
nothing
to
fear
now
the
matter
is
absolutely
we
only
put
on
a
painter
why
haven
t
i
told
you
about
it
i
only
told
you
the
beginning
then
about
the
murder
of
the
old
well
the
painter
is
mixed
up
in
it
oh
i
heard
about
that
murder
before
and
wa
rather
interested
in
it
partly
for
one
reason
i
read
about
it
in
the
paper
too
lizaveta
wa
murdered
too
nastasya
blurted
out
suddenly
addressing
raskolnikov
she
remained
in
the
room
all
the
time
standing
by
the
door
listening
lizaveta
murmured
raskolnikov
hardly
audibly
lizaveta
who
sold
old
clothes
didn
t
you
know
her
she
used
to
come
here
she
mended
a
shirt
for
you
raskolnikov
turned
to
the
wall
where
in
the
dirty
yellow
paper
he
picked
out
one
clumsy
white
flower
with
brown
line
on
it
and
began
examining
how
many
petal
there
were
in
it
how
many
scallop
in
the
petal
and
how
many
line
on
them
he
felt
his
arm
and
leg
a
lifeless
a
though
they
had
been
cut
off
he
did
not
attempt
to
move
but
stared
obstinately
at
the
flower
but
what
about
the
painter
zossimov
interrupted
nastasya
s
chatter
with
marked
displeasure
she
sighed
and
wa
silent
why
he
wa
accused
of
the
murder
razumihin
went
on
hotly
wa
there
evidence
against
him
then
evidence
indeed
evidence
that
wa
no
evidence
and
that
s
what
we
have
to
prove
it
wa
just
a
they
pitched
on
those
fellow
koch
and
pestryakov
at
first
foo
how
stupidly
it
s
all
done
it
make
one
sick
though
it
s
not
one
s
business
pestryakov
may
be
coming
by
the
way
rodya
you
ve
heard
about
the
business
already
it
happened
before
you
were
ill
the
day
before
you
fainted
at
the
police
office
while
they
were
talking
about
zossimov
looked
curiously
at
raskolnikov
he
did
not
stir
but
i
say
razumihin
i
wonder
at
you
what
a
busybody
you
are
zossimov
observed
maybe
i
am
but
we
will
get
him
off
anyway
shouted
razumihin
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
what
s
the
most
offensive
is
not
their
lying
one
can
always
forgive
lying
lying
is
a
delightful
thing
for
it
lead
to
truth
what
is
offensive
is
that
they
lie
and
worship
their
own
lying
i
respect
porfiry
but
what
threw
them
out
at
first
the
door
wa
locked
and
when
they
came
back
with
the
porter
it
wa
open
so
it
followed
that
koch
and
pestryakov
were
the
murderer
that
wa
their
logic
but
don
t
excite
yourself
they
simply
detained
them
they
could
not
help
that
and
by
the
way
i
ve
met
that
man
koch
he
used
to
buy
unredeemed
pledge
from
the
old
woman
eh
yes
he
is
a
swindler
he
buy
up
bad
debt
too
he
make
a
profession
of
it
but
enough
of
him
do
you
know
what
make
me
angry
it
s
their
sickening
rotten
petrified
routine
and
this
case
might
be
the
mean
of
introducing
a
new
method
one
can
show
from
the
psychological
data
alone
how
to
get
on
the
track
of
the
real
man
we
have
fact
they
say
but
fact
are
not
everything
at
least
half
the
business
lie
in
how
you
interpret
them
can
you
interpret
them
then
anyway
one
can
t
hold
one
s
tongue
when
one
ha
a
feeling
a
tangible
feeling
that
one
might
be
a
help
if
only
eh
do
you
know
the
detail
of
the
case
i
am
waiting
to
hear
about
the
oh
yes
well
here
s
the
story
early
on
the
third
day
after
the
murder
when
they
were
still
dandling
koch
and
pestryakov
though
they
accounted
for
every
step
they
took
and
it
wa
a
plain
a
a
pikestaff
an
unexpected
fact
turned
up
a
peasant
called
dushkin
who
keep
a
facing
the
house
brought
to
the
police
office
a
jeweller
s
case
containing
some
gold
and
told
a
long
rigamarole
the
day
before
yesterday
just
after
eight
o
clock
mark
the
day
and
the
hour
a
journeyman
nikolay
who
had
been
in
to
see
me
already
that
day
brought
me
this
box
of
gold
and
stone
and
asked
me
to
give
him
two
rouble
for
them
when
i
asked
him
where
he
got
them
he
said
that
he
picked
them
up
in
the
street
i
did
not
ask
him
anything
i
am
telling
you
dushkin
s
story
i
gave
him
a
note
a
rouble
that
is
for
i
thought
if
he
did
not
pawn
it
with
me
he
would
with
another
it
would
all
come
to
the
same
thing
he
d
spend
it
on
drink
so
the
thing
had
better
be
with
me
the
further
you
hide
it
the
quicker
you
will
find
it
and
if
anything
turn
up
if
i
hear
any
rumour
i
ll
take
it
to
the
of
course
that
s
all
taradiddle
he
lie
like
a
horse
for
i
know
this
dushkin
he
is
a
pawnbroker
and
a
receiver
of
stolen
good
and
he
did
not
cheat
nikolay
out
of
a
trinket
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
police
he
wa
simply
afraid
but
no
matter
to
return
to
dushkin
s
story
i
ve
known
this
peasant
nikolay
dementyev
from
a
child
he
come
from
the
same
province
and
district
of
zaraïsk
we
are
both
ryazan
men
and
though
nikolay
is
not
a
drunkard
he
drink
and
i
knew
he
had
a
job
in
that
house
painting
work
with
dmitri
who
come
from
the
same
village
too
a
soon
a
he
got
the
rouble
he
changed
it
had
a
couple
of
glass
took
his
change
and
went
out
but
i
did
not
see
dmitri
with
him
then
and
the
next
day
i
heard
that
someone
had
murdered
alyona
ivanovna
and
her
sister
lizaveta
ivanovna
with
an
axe
i
knew
them
and
i
felt
suspicious
about
the
at
once
for
i
knew
the
murdered
woman
lent
money
on
pledge
i
went
to
the
house
and
began
to
make
careful
inquiry
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone
first
of
all
i
asked
is
nikolay
here
dmitri
told
me
that
nikolay
had
gone
off
on
the
spree
he
had
come
home
at
daybreak
drunk
stayed
in
the
house
about
ten
minute
and
went
out
again
dmitri
didn
t
see
him
again
and
is
finishing
the
job
alone
and
their
job
is
on
the
same
staircase
a
the

i
did
not
say
a
word
to
anyone
that
s
dushkin
s
tale
but
i
found
out
what
i
could
about
the
murder
and
went
home
feeling
a
suspicious
a
ever
and
at
eight
o
clock
this
morning
that
wa
the
third
day
you
understand
i
saw
nikolay
coming
in
not
sober
though
not
to
say
very
drunk
he
could
understand
what
wa
said
to
him
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
did
not
speak
there
wa
only
one
stranger
in
the
bar
and
a
man
i
knew
asleep
on
a
bench
and
our
two
boy
have
you
seen

haven
t
said
he
and
you
ve
not
been
here
either
not
since
the
day
before
yesterday
said
he
and
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
in
peski
with
the
kolomensky
and
where
did
you
get
those
i
asked
i
found
them
in
the
street
and
the
way
he
said
it
wa
a
bit
queer
he
did
not
look
at
me
did
you
hear
what
happened
that
very
evening
at
that
very
hour
on
that
same
staircase
said
i
no
said
he
i
had
not
heard
and
all
the
while
he
wa
listening
his
eye
were
staring
out
of
his
head
and
he
turned
a
white
a
chalk
i
told
him
all
about
it
and
he
took
his
hat
and
began
getting
up
i
wanted
to
keep
him
wait
a
bit
nikolay
said
i
won
t
you
have
a
drink
and
i
signed
to
the
boy
to
hold
the
door
and
i
came
out
from
behind
the
bar
but
he
darted
out
and
down
the
street
to
the
turning
at
a
run
i
have
not
seen
him
since
then
my
doubt
were
at
an
end
it
wa
his
doing
a
clear
a
could
be
i
should
think
so
said
zossimov
wait
hear
the
end
of
course
they
sought
high
and
low
for
nikolay
they
detained
dushkin
and
searched
his
house
dmitri
too
wa
arrested
the
kolomensky
men
also
were
turned
inside
out
and
the
day
before
yesterday
they
arrested
nikolay
in
a
tavern
at
the
end
of
the
town
he
had
gone
there
taken
the
silver
cross
off
his
neck
and
asked
for
a
dram
for
it
they
gave
it
to
him
a
few
minute
afterwards
the
woman
went
to
the
cowshed
and
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
she
saw
in
the
stable
adjoining
he
had
made
a
noose
of
his
sash
from
the
beam
stood
on
a
block
of
wood
and
wa
trying
to
put
his
neck
in
the
noose
the
woman
screeched
her
hardest
people
ran
in
so
that
s
what
you
are
up
to
take
me
he
say
to
a
police
officer
i
ll
confess
well
they
took
him
to
that
police
station
that
is
here
with
a
suitable
escort
so
they
asked
him
this
and
that
how
old
he
is
and
so
on
at
the
question
when
you
were
working
with
dmitri
didn
t
you
see
anyone
on
the
staircase
at
a
time
answer
to
be
sure
folk
may
have
gone
up
and
down
but
i
did
not
notice
and
didn
t
you
hear
anything
any
noise
and
so
on
we
heard
nothing
and
did
you
hear
nikolay
that
on
the
same
day
widow
and
her
sister
were
murdered
and
robbed
i
never
knew
a
thing
about
it
the
first
i
heard
of
it
wa
from
afanasy
pavlovitch
the
day
before
and
where
did
you
find
the
i
found
them
on
the
why
didn
t
you
go
to
work
with
dmitri
the
other
day
because
i
wa
and
where
were
you
drinking
oh
in
a
why
did
you
run
away
from
dushkin
s
because
i
wa
awfully
what
were
you
frightened
of
that
i
should
be
how
could
you
be
frightened
if
you
felt
free
from
guilt
now
zossimov
you
may
not
believe
me
that
question
wa
put
literally
in
those
word
i
know
it
for
a
fact
it
wa
repeated
to
me
exactly
what
do
you
say
to
that
well
anyway
there
s
the
i
am
not
talking
of
the
evidence
now
i
am
talking
about
that
question
of
their
own
idea
of
themselves
well
so
they
squeezed
and
squeezed
him
and
he
confessed
i
did
not
find
it
in
the
street
but
in
the
flat
where
i
wa
painting
with
and
how
wa
that
why
dmitri
and
i
were
painting
there
all
day
and
we
were
just
getting
ready
to
go
and
dmitri
took
a
brush
and
painted
my
face
and
he
ran
off
and
i
after
him
i
ran
after
him
shouting
my
hardest
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
i
ran
right
against
the
porter
and
some
gentleman
and
how
many
gentleman
were
there
i
don
t
remember
and
the
porter
swore
at
me
and
the
other
porter
swore
too
and
the
porter
s
wife
came
out
and
swore
at
u
too
and
a
gentleman
came
into
the
entry
with
a
lady
and
he
swore
at
u
too
for
dmitri
and
i
lay
right
across
the
way
i
got
hold
of
dmitri
s
hair
and
knocked
him
down
and
began
beating
him
and
dmitri
too
caught
me
by
the
hair
and
began
beating
me
but
we
did
it
all
not
for
temper
but
in
a
friendly
way
for
sport
and
then
dmitri
escaped
and
ran
into
the
street
and
i
ran
after
him
but
i
did
not
catch
him
and
went
back
to
the
flat
alone
i
had
to
clear
up
my
thing
i
began
putting
them
together
expecting
dmitri
to
come
and
there
in
the
passage
in
the
corner
by
the
door
i
stepped
on
the
box
i
saw
it
lying
there
wrapped
up
in
paper
i
took
off
the
paper
saw
some
little
hook
undid
them
and
in
the
box
were
the
behind
the
door
lying
behind
the
door
behind
the
door
raskolnikov
cried
suddenly
staring
with
a
blank
look
of
terror
at
razumihin
and
he
slowly
sat
up
on
the
sofa
leaning
on
his
hand
yes
why
what
s
the
matter
what
s
wrong
razumihin
too
got
up
from
his
seat
nothing
raskolnikov
answered
faintly
turning
to
the
wall
all
were
silent
for
a
while
he
must
have
waked
from
a
dream
razumihin
said
at
last
looking
inquiringly
at
zossimov
the
latter
slightly
shook
his
head
well
go
on
said
zossimov
what
next
what
next
a
soon
a
he
saw
the
forgetting
dmitri
and
everything
he
took
up
his
cap
and
ran
to
dushkin
and
a
we
know
got
a
rouble
from
him
he
told
a
lie
saying
he
found
them
in
the
street
and
went
off
drinking
he
keep
repeating
his
old
story
about
the
murder
i
know
nothing
of
it
never
heard
of
it
till
the
day
before
and
why
didn
t
you
come
to
the
police
till
now
i
wa
and
why
did
you
try
to
hang
yourself
from
what
anxiety
that
i
should
be
accused
of
well
that
s
the
whole
story
and
now
what
do
you
suppose
they
deduced
from
that
why
there
s
no
supposing
there
s
a
clue
such
a
it
is
a
fact
you
wouldn
t
have
your
painter
set
free
now
they
ve
simply
taken
him
for
the
murderer
they
haven
t
a
shadow
of
that
s
nonsense
you
are
excited
but
what
about
the
you
must
admit
that
if
on
the
very
same
day
and
hour
from
the
old
woman
s
box
have
come
into
nikolay
s
hand
they
must
have
come
there
somehow
that
s
a
good
deal
in
such
a
how
did
they
get
there
how
did
they
get
there
cried
razumihin
how
can
you
a
doctor
whose
duty
it
is
to
study
man
and
who
ha
more
opportunity
than
anyone
else
for
studying
human
nature
how
can
you
fail
to
see
the
character
of
the
man
in
the
whole
story
don
t
you
see
at
once
that
the
answer
he
ha
given
in
the
examination
are
the
holy
truth
they
came
into
his
hand
precisely
a
he
ha
told
u
he
stepped
on
the
box
and
picked
it
the
holy
truth
but
didn
t
he
own
himself
that
he
told
a
lie
at
first
listen
to
me
listen
attentively
the
porter
and
koch
and
pestryakov
and
the
other
porter
and
the
wife
of
the
first
porter
and
the
woman
who
wa
sitting
in
the
porter
s
lodge
and
the
man
kryukov
who
had
just
got
out
of
a
cab
at
that
minute
and
went
in
at
the
entry
with
a
lady
on
his
arm
that
is
eight
or
ten
witness
agree
that
nikolay
had
dmitri
on
the
ground
wa
lying
on
him
beating
him
while
dmitri
hung
on
to
his
hair
beating
him
too
they
lay
right
across
the
way
blocking
the
thoroughfare
they
were
sworn
at
on
all
side
while
they
like
child
the
very
word
of
the
witness
were
falling
over
one
another
squealing
fighting
and
laughing
with
the
funniest
face
and
chasing
one
another
like
child
they
ran
into
the
street
now
take
careful
note
the
body
upstairs
were
warm
you
understand
warm
when
they
found
them
if
they
or
nikolay
alone
had
murdered
them
and
broken
open
the
box
or
simply
taken
part
in
the
robbery
allow
me
to
ask
you
one
question
do
their
state
of
mind
their
squeal
and
giggle
and
childish
scuffling
at
the
gate
fit
in
with
ax
bloodshed
fiendish
cunning
robbery
they
d
just
killed
them
not
five
or
ten
minute
before
for
the
body
were
still
warm
and
at
once
leaving
the
flat
open
knowing
that
people
would
go
there
at
once
flinging
away
their
booty
they
rolled
about
like
child
laughing
and
attracting
general
attention
and
there
are
a
dozen
witness
to
swear
to
that
of
course
it
is
strange
it
s
impossible
indeed
but
no
brother
no
and
if
the
being
found
in
nikolay
s
hand
at
the
very
day
and
hour
of
the
murder
constitutes
an
important
piece
of
circumstantial
evidence
against
him
although
the
explanation
given
by
him
account
for
it
and
therefore
it
doe
not
tell
seriously
against
him
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
fact
which
prove
him
innocent
especially
a
they
are
fact
that
be
and
do
you
suppose
from
the
character
of
our
legal
system
that
they
will
accept
or
that
they
are
in
a
position
to
accept
this
fact
resting
simply
on
a
psychological
impossibility
a
irrefutable
and
conclusively
breaking
down
the
circumstantial
evidence
for
the
prosecution
no
they
won
t
accept
it
they
certainly
won
t
because
they
found
the
and
the
man
tried
to
hang
himself
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
he
hadn
t
felt
that
s
the
point
that
s
what
excites
me
you
must
understand
oh
i
see
you
are
excited
wait
a
bit
i
forgot
to
ask
you
what
proof
is
there
that
the
box
came
from
the
old
woman
that
s
been
proved
said
razumihin
with
apparent
reluctance
frowning
koch
recognised
the
and
gave
the
name
of
the
owner
who
proved
conclusively
that
it
wa
that
s
bad
now
another
point
did
anyone
see
nikolay
at
the
time
that
koch
and
pestryakov
were
going
upstairs
at
first
and
is
there
no
evidence
about
that
nobody
did
see
him
razumihin
answered
with
vexation
that
s
the
worst
of
it
even
koch
and
pestryakov
did
not
notice
them
on
their
way
upstairs
though
indeed
their
evidence
could
not
have
been
worth
much
they
said
they
saw
the
flat
wa
open
and
that
there
must
be
work
going
on
in
it
but
they
took
no
special
notice
and
could
not
remember
whether
there
actually
were
men
at
work
in
hm
so
the
only
evidence
for
the
defence
is
that
they
were
beating
one
another
and
laughing
that
constitutes
a
strong
presumption
but
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
yourself
how
do
i
explain
them
what
is
there
to
explain
it
s
clear
at
any
rate
the
direction
in
which
explanation
is
to
be
sought
is
clear
and
the
point
to

the

murderer

those
the
murderer
wa
upstairs
locked
in
when
koch
and
pestryakov
knocked
at
the
door
koch
like
an
as
did
not
stay
at
the
door
so
the
murderer
popped
out
and
ran
down
too
for
he
had
no
other
way
of
escape
he
hid
from
koch
pestryakov
and
the
porter
in
the
flat
when
nikolay
and
dmitri
had
just
run
out
of
it
he
stopped
there
while
the
porter
and
others
were
going
upstairs
waited
till
they
were
out
of
hearing
and
then
went
calmly
downstairs
at
the
very
minute
when
dmitri
and
nikolay
ran
out
into
the
street
and
there
wa
no
one
in
the
entry
possibly
he
wa
seen
but
not
noticed
there
are
lot
of
people
going
in
and
out
he
must
have
dropped
the
out
of
his
pocket
when
he
stood
behind
the
door
and
did
not
notice
he
dropped
them
because
he
had
other
thing
to
think
of
the
is
a
conclusive
proof
that
he
did
stand
there
that
s
how
i
explain
too
clever
no
my
boy
you
re
too
clever
that
beat
but
why
why
why
because
everything
fit
too
well
it
s
too
razumihin
wa
exclaiming
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
personage
came
in
who
wa
a
stranger
to
all
present
chapter
v
this
wa
a
gentleman
no
longer
young
of
a
stiff
and
portly
appearance
and
a
cautious
and
sour
countenance
he
began
by
stopping
short
in
the
doorway
staring
about
him
with
offensive
and
undisguised
astonishment
a
though
asking
himself
what
sort
of
place
he
had
come
to
mistrustfully
and
with
an
affectation
of
being
alarmed
and
almost
affronted
he
scanned
raskolnikov
s
low
and
narrow
with
the
same
amazement
he
stared
at
raskolnikov
who
lay
undressed
dishevelled
unwashed
on
his
miserable
dirty
sofa
looking
fixedly
at
him
then
with
the
same
deliberation
he
scrutinised
the
uncouth
unkempt
figure
and
unshaven
face
of
razumihin
who
looked
him
boldly
and
inquiringly
in
the
face
without
rising
from
his
seat
a
constrained
silence
lasted
for
a
couple
of
minute
and
then
a
might
be
expected
some
took
place
reflecting
probably
from
certain
fairly
unmistakable
sign
that
he
would
get
nothing
in
this
cabin
by
attempting
to
overawe
them
the
gentleman
softened
somewhat
and
civilly
though
with
some
severity
emphasising
every
syllable
of
his
question
addressed
zossimov
rodion
romanovitch
raskolnikov
a
student
or
formerly
a
student
zossimov
made
a
slight
movement
and
would
have
answered
had
not
razumihin
anticipated
him
here
he
is
lying
on
the
sofa
what
do
you
want
this
familiar
what
do
you
want
seemed
to
cut
the
ground
from
the
foot
of
the
pompous
gentleman
he
wa
turning
to
razumihin
but
checked
himself
in
time
and
turned
to
zossimov
again
this
is
raskolnikov
mumbled
zossimov
nodding
towards
him
then
he
gave
a
prolonged
yawn
opening
his
mouth
a
wide
a
possible
then
he
lazily
put
his
hand
into
his
pulled
out
a
huge
gold
watch
in
a
round
hunter
s
case
opened
it
looked
at
it
and
a
slowly
and
lazily
proceeded
to
put
it
back
raskolnikov
himself
lay
without
speaking
on
his
back
gazing
persistently
though
without
understanding
at
the
stranger
now
that
his
face
wa
turned
away
from
the
strange
flower
on
the
paper
it
wa
extremely
pale
and
wore
a
look
of
anguish
a
though
he
had
just
undergone
an
agonising
operation
or
just
been
taken
from
the
rack
but
the
gradually
began
to
arouse
his
attention
then
his
wonder
then
suspicion
and
even
alarm
when
zossimov
said
this
is
raskolnikov
he
jumped
up
quickly
sat
on
the
sofa
and
with
an
almost
defiant
but
weak
and
breaking
voice
articulated
yes
i
am
raskolnikov
what
do
you
want
the
visitor
scrutinised
him
and
pronounced
impressively
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
i
believe
i
have
reason
to
hope
that
my
name
is
not
wholly
unknown
to
you
but
raskolnikov
who
had
expected
something
quite
different
gazed
blankly
and
dreamily
at
him
making
no
reply
a
though
he
heard
the
name
of
pyotr
petrovitch
for
the
first
time
is
it
possible
that
you
can
up
to
the
present
have
received
no
information
asked
pyotr
petrovitch
somewhat
disconcerted
in
reply
raskolnikov
sank
languidly
back
on
the
pillow
put
his
hand
behind
his
head
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
a
look
of
dismay
came
into
luzhin
s
face
zossimov
and
razumihin
stared
at
him
more
inquisitively
than
ever
and
at
last
he
showed
unmistakable
sign
of
embarrassment
i
had
presumed
and
calculated
he
faltered
that
a
letter
posted
more
than
ten
day
if
not
a
fortnight
ago
i
say
why
are
you
standing
in
the
doorway
razumihin
interrupted
suddenly
if
you
ve
something
to
say
sit
down
nastasya
and
you
are
so
crowded
nastasya
make
room
here
s
a
chair
thread
your
way
in
he
moved
his
chair
back
from
the
table
made
a
little
space
between
the
table
and
his
knee
and
waited
in
a
rather
cramped
position
for
the
visitor
to
thread
his
way
the
minute
wa
so
chosen
that
it
wa
impossible
to
refuse
and
the
visitor
squeezed
his
way
through
hurrying
and
stumbling
reaching
the
chair
he
sat
down
looking
suspiciously
at
razumihin
no
need
to
be
nervous
the
latter
blurted
out
rodya
ha
been
ill
for
the
last
five
day
and
delirious
for
three
but
now
he
is
recovering
and
ha
got
an
appetite
this
is
his
doctor
who
ha
just
had
a
look
at
him
i
am
a
comrade
of
rodya
s
like
him
formerly
a
student
and
now
i
am
nursing
him
so
don
t
you
take
any
notice
of
u
but
go
on
with
your
thank
you
but
shall
i
not
disturb
the
invalid
by
my
presence
and
conversation
pyotr
petrovitch
asked
of
zossimov
mumbled
zossimov
you
may
amuse
he
yawned
again
he
ha
been
conscious
a
long
time
since
the
morning
went
on
razumihin
whose
familiarity
seemed
so
much
like
unaffected
that
pyotr
petrovitch
began
to
be
more
cheerful
partly
perhaps
because
this
shabby
and
impudent
person
had
introduced
himself
a
a
student
your
mamma
began
luzhin
hm
razumihin
cleared
his
throat
loudly
luzhin
looked
at
him
inquiringly
that
s
all
right
go
luzhin
shrugged
his
shoulder
your
mamma
had
commenced
a
letter
to
you
while
i
wa
sojourning
in
her
neighbourhood
on
my
arrival
here
i
purposely
allowed
a
few
day
to
elapse
before
coming
to
see
you
in
order
that
i
might
be
fully
assured
that
you
were
in
full
possession
of
the
tidings
but
now
to
my
astonishment
i
know
i
know
raskolnikov
cried
suddenly
with
impatient
vexation
so
you
are
the
i
know
and
that
s
enough
there
wa
no
doubt
about
pyotr
petrovitch
s
being
offended
this
time
but
he
said
nothing
he
made
a
violent
effort
to
understand
what
it
all
meant
there
wa
a
moment
s
silence
meanwhile
raskolnikov
who
had
turned
a
little
towards
him
when
he
answered
began
suddenly
staring
at
him
again
with
marked
curiosity
a
though
he
had
not
had
a
good
look
at
him
yet
or
a
though
something
new
had
struck
him
he
rose
from
his
pillow
on
purpose
to
stare
at
him
there
certainly
wa
something
peculiar
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
whole
appearance
something
which
seemed
to
justify
the
title
of
fiancé
so
unceremoniously
applied
to
him
in
the
first
place
it
wa
evident
far
too
much
so
indeed
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
made
eager
use
of
his
few
day
in
the
capital
to
get
himself
up
and
rig
himself
out
in
expectation
of
his
betrothed
a
perfectly
innocent
and
permissible
proceeding
indeed
even
his
own
perhaps
too
complacent
consciousness
of
the
agreeable
improvement
in
his
appearance
might
have
been
forgiven
in
such
circumstance
seeing
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
taken
up
the
rôle
of
fiancé
all
his
clothes
were
fresh
from
the
tailor
s
and
were
all
right
except
for
being
too
new
and
too
distinctly
appropriate
even
the
stylish
new
round
hat
had
the
same
significance
pyotr
petrovitch
treated
it
too
respectfully
and
held
it
too
carefully
in
his
hand
the
exquisite
pair
of
lavender
glove
real
louvain
told
the
same
tale
if
only
from
the
fact
of
his
not
wearing
them
but
carrying
them
in
his
hand
for
show
light
and
youthful
colour
predominated
in
pyotr
petrovitch
s
attire
he
wore
a
charming
summer
jacket
of
a
fawn
shade
light
thin
trouser
a
waistcoat
of
the
same
new
and
fine
linen
a
cravat
of
the
lightest
cambric
with
pink
stripe
on
it
and
the
best
of
it
wa
this
all
suited
pyotr
petrovitch
his
very
fresh
and
even
handsome
face
looked
younger
than
his
year
at
all
time
his
dark
whisker
made
an
agreeable
setting
on
both
side
growing
thickly
upon
his
shining
chin
even
his
hair
touched
here
and
there
with
grey
though
it
had
been
combed
and
curled
at
a
hairdresser
s
did
not
give
him
a
stupid
appearance
a
curled
hair
usually
doe
by
inevitably
suggesting
a
german
on
his
if
there
really
wa
something
unpleasing
and
repulsive
in
his
rather
and
imposing
countenance
it
wa
due
to
quite
other
cause
after
scanning
luzhin
unceremoniously
raskolnikov
smiled
malignantly
sank
back
on
the
pillow
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
a
before
but
luzhin
hardened
his
heart
and
seemed
to
determine
to
take
no
notice
of
their
oddity
i
feel
the
greatest
regret
at
finding
you
in
this
situation
he
began
again
breaking
the
silence
with
an
effort
if
i
had
been
aware
of
your
illness
i
should
have
come
earlier
but
you
know
what
business
is
i
have
too
a
very
important
legal
affair
in
the
senate
not
to
mention
other
preoccupation
which
you
may
well
conjecture
i
am
expecting
your
mamma
and
sister
any
raskolnikov
made
a
movement
and
seemed
about
to
speak
his
face
showed
some
excitement
pyotr
petrovitch
paused
waited
but
a
nothing
followed
he
went
on
any
minute
i
have
found
a
lodging
for
them
on
their
where
asked
raskolnikov
weakly
very
near
here
in
bakaleyev
s
that
s
in
voskresensky
put
in
razumihin
there
are
two
storey
of
room
let
by
a
merchant
called
yushin
i
ve
been
yes
room
a
disgusting
place
filthy
stinking
and
what
s
more
of
doubtful
character
thing
have
happened
there
and
there
are
all
sort
of
queer
people
living
there
and
i
went
there
about
a
scandalous
business
it
s
cheap
though
i
could
not
of
course
find
out
so
much
about
it
for
i
am
a
stranger
in
petersburg
myself
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
huffily
however
the
two
room
are
exceedingly
clean
and
a
it
is
for
so
short
a
time
i
have
already
taken
a
permanent
that
is
our
future
flat
he
said
addressing
raskolnikov
and
i
am
having
it
done
up
and
meanwhile
i
am
myself
cramped
for
room
in
a
lodging
with
my
friend
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
in
the
flat
of
madame
lippevechsel
it
wa
he
who
told
me
of
bakaleyev
s
house
too
lebeziatnikov
said
raskolnikov
slowly
a
if
recalling
something
yes
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
a
clerk
in
the
ministry
do
you
know
him
yes
no
raskolnikov
answered
excuse
me
i
fancied
so
from
your
inquiry
i
wa
once
his
guardian
a
very
nice
young
man
and
advanced
i
like
to
meet
young
people
one
learns
new
thing
from
luzhin
looked
round
hopefully
at
them
all
how
do
you
mean
asked
razumihin
in
the
most
serious
and
essential
matter
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
a
though
delighted
at
the
question
you
see
it
s
ten
year
since
i
visited
petersburg
all
the
novelty
reform
idea
have
reached
u
in
the
province
but
to
see
it
all
more
clearly
one
must
be
in
petersburg
and
it
s
my
notion
that
you
observe
and
learn
most
by
watching
the
younger
generation
and
i
confess
i
am
delighted
at
what
your
question
is
a
wide
one
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
fancy
i
find
clearer
view
more
so

let
drop
nonsense
there

no
razumihin
flew
at
him
practicality
is
a
difficult
thing
to
find
it
doe
not
drop
down
from
heaven
and
for
the
last
two
hundred
year
we
have
been
divorced
from
all
practical
life
idea
if
you
like
are
fermenting
he
said
to
pyotr
petrovitch
and
desire
for
good
exists
though
it
s
in
a
childish
form
and
honesty
you
may
find
although
there
are
crowd
of
brigand
anyway
there
s
no
practicality
practicality
go
well
i
don
t
agree
with
you
pyotr
petrovitch
replied
with
evident
enjoyment
of
course
people
do
get
carried
away
and
make
mistake
but
one
must
have
indulgence
those
mistake
are
merely
evidence
of
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
and
of
abnormal
external
environment
if
little
ha
been
done
the
time
ha
been
but
short
of
mean
i
will
not
speak
it
s
my
personal
view
if
you
care
to
know
that
something
ha
been
accomplished
already
new
valuable
idea
new
valuable
work
are
circulating
in
the
place
of
our
old
dreamy
and
romantic
author
literature
is
taking
a
maturer
form
many
injurious
prejudice
have
been
rooted
up
and
turned
into
ridicule
in
a
word
we
have
cut
ourselves
off
irrevocably
from
the
past
and
that
to
my
thinking
is
a
great
thing
he
s
learnt
it
by
heart
to
show
off
raskolnikov
pronounced
suddenly
what
asked
pyotr
petrovitch
not
catching
his
word
but
he
received
no
reply
that
s
all
true
zossimov
hastened
to
interpose
isn
t
it
so
pyotr
petrovitch
went
on
glancing
affably
at
zossimov
you
must
admit
he
went
on
addressing
razumihin
with
a
shade
of
triumph
and
superciliousness
he
almost
added
young
man
that
there
is
an
advance
or
a
they
say
now
progress
in
the
name
of
science
and
economic
truth
a
no
not
a
commonplace
hitherto
for
instance
if
i
were
told
love
thy
neighbour
what
came
of
it
pyotr
petrovitch
went
on
perhaps
with
excessive
haste
it
came
to
my
tearing
my
coat
in
half
to
share
with
my
neighbour
and
we
both
were
left
half
naked
a
a
russian
proverb
ha
it
catch
several
hare
and
you
won
t
catch
science
now
tell
u
love
yourself
before
all
men
for
everything
in
the
world
rest
on
you
love
yourself
and
manage
your
own
affair
properly
and
your
coat
remains
whole
economic
truth
add
that
the
better
private
affair
are
organised
in
society
the
more
whole
coat
so
to
say
the
firmer
are
it
foundation
and
the
better
is
the
common
welfare
organised
too
therefore
in
acquiring
wealth
solely
and
exclusively
for
myself
i
am
acquiring
so
to
speak
for
all
and
helping
to
bring
to
pas
my
neighbour
s
getting
a
little
more
than
a
torn
coat
and
that
not
from
private
personal
liberality
but
a
a
consequence
of
the
general
advance
the
idea
is
simple
but
unhappily
it
ha
been
a
long
time
reaching
u
being
hindered
by
idealism
and
sentimentality
and
yet
it
would
seem
to
want
very
little
wit
to
perceive
it
excuse
me
i
ve
very
little
wit
myself
razumihin
cut
in
sharply
and
so
let
u
drop
it
i
began
this
discussion
with
an
object
but
i
ve
grown
so
sick
during
the
last
three
year
of
this
chattering
to
amuse
oneself
of
this
incessant
flow
of
commonplace
always
the
same
that
by
jove
i
blush
even
when
other
people
talk
like
that
you
are
in
a
hurry
no
doubt
to
exhibit
your
acquirement
and
i
don
t
blame
you
that
s
quite
pardonable
i
only
wanted
to
find
out
what
sort
of
man
you
are
for
so
many
unscrupulous
people
have
got
hold
of
the
progressive
cause
of
late
and
have
so
distorted
in
their
own
interest
everything
they
touched
that
the
whole
cause
ha
been
dragged
in
the
mire
that
s
enough
excuse
me
sir
said
luzhin
affronted
and
speaking
with
excessive
dignity
do
you
mean
to
suggest
so
unceremoniously
that
i
too
oh
my
dear
sir
how
could
i
come
that
s
enough
razumihin
concluded
and
he
turned
abruptly
to
zossimov
to
continue
their
previous
conversation
pyotr
petrovitch
had
the
good
sense
to
accept
the
disavowal
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
leave
in
another
minute
or
two
i
trust
our
acquaintance
he
said
addressing
raskolnikov
may
upon
your
recovery
and
in
view
of
the
circumstance
of
which
you
are
aware
become
closer
above
all
i
hope
for
your
return
to
health
raskolnikov
did
not
even
turn
his
head
pyotr
petrovitch
began
getting
up
from
his
chair
one
of
her
customer
must
have
killed
her
zossimov
declared
positively
not
a
doubt
of
it
replied
razumihin
porfiry
doesn
t
give
his
opinion
but
is
examining
all
who
have
left
pledge
with
her
examining
them
raskolnikov
asked
aloud
yes
what
then
how
doe
he
get
hold
of
them
asked
zossimov
koch
ha
given
the
name
of
some
of
them
other
name
are
on
the
wrapper
of
the
pledge
and
some
have
come
forward
of
it
must
have
been
a
cunning
and
practised
ruffian
the
boldness
of
it
the
coolness
that
s
just
what
it
wasn
t
interposed
razumihin
that
s
what
throw
you
all
off
the
scent
but
i
maintain
that
he
is
not
cunning
not
practised
and
probably
this
wa
his
first
crime
the
supposition
that
it
wa
a
calculated
crime
and
a
cunning
criminal
doesn
t
work
suppose
him
to
have
been
inexperienced
and
it
s
clear
that
it
wa
only
a
chance
that
saved
him
and
chance
may
do
anything
why
he
did
not
foresee
obstacle
perhaps
and
how
did
he
set
to
work
he
took
jewel
worth
ten
or
twenty
rouble
stuffing
his
pocket
with
them
ransacked
the
old
woman
s
trunk
her
rag
and
they
found
fifteen
hundred
rouble
besides
note
in
a
box
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
chest
he
did
not
know
how
to
rob
he
could
only
murder
it
wa
his
first
crime
i
assure
you
his
first
crime
he
lost
his
head
and
he
got
off
more
by
luck
than
good
counsel
you
are
talking
of
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker
i
believe
pyotr
petrovitch
put
in
addressing
zossimov
he
wa
standing
hat
and
glove
in
hand
but
before
departing
he
felt
disposed
to
throw
off
a
few
more
intellectual
phrase
he
wa
evidently
anxious
to
make
a
favourable
impression
and
his
vanity
overcame
his
prudence
yes
you
ve
heard
of
it
oh
yes
being
in
the
do
you
know
the
detail
i
can
t
say
that
but
another
circumstance
interest
me
in
the
case
the
whole
question
so
to
say
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
crime
ha
been
greatly
on
the
increase
among
the
lower
class
during
the
last
five
year
not
to
speak
of
the
case
of
robbery
and
arson
everywhere
what
strike
me
a
the
strangest
thing
is
that
in
the
higher
class
too
crime
is
increasing
proportionately
in
one
place
one
hears
of
a
student
s
robbing
the
mail
on
the
high
road
in
another
place
people
of
good
social
position
forge
false
banknote
in
moscow
of
late
a
whole
gang
ha
been
captured
who
used
to
forge
lottery
ticket
and
one
of
the
ringleader
wa
a
lecturer
in
universal
history
then
our
secretary
abroad
wa
murdered
from
some
obscure
motive
of
gain
and
if
this
old
woman
the
pawnbroker
ha
been
murdered
by
someone
of
a
higher
class
in
society
for
peasant
don
t
pawn
gold
trinket
how
are
we
to
explain
this
demoralisation
of
the
civilised
part
of
our
society
there
are
many
economic
change
put
in
zossimov
how
are
we
to
explain
it
razumihin
caught
him
up
it
might
be
explained
by
our
inveterate
how
do
you
mean
what
answer
had
your
lecturer
in
moscow
to
make
to
the
question
why
he
wa
forging
note
everybody
is
getting
rich
one
way
or
another
so
i
want
to
make
haste
to
get
rich
i
don
t
remember
the
exact
word
but
the
upshot
wa
that
he
want
money
for
nothing
without
waiting
or
working
we
ve
grown
used
to
having
everything
to
walking
on
crutch
to
having
our
food
chewed
for
u
then
the
great
hour
struck
and
every
man
showed
himself
in
his
true
the
emancipation
of
the
serf
in

meant
translator

morality
and
so
to
speak
principle
but
why
do
you
worry
about
it
raskolnikov
interposed
suddenly
it
s
in
accordance
with
your
theory
in
accordance
with
my
theory
why
carry
out
logically
the
theory
you
were
advocating
just
now
and
it
follows
that
people
may
be
killed
upon
my
word
cried
luzhin
no
that
s
not
so
put

with
a

face
and
twitching

painfully
there

luzhin
went
on
superciliously
economic
idea
are
not
an
incitement

and
one
ha
but
to

and
is
it
true
raskolnikov
interposed
once
more
suddenly
again
in
a
voice
quivering
with
fury
and
delight
in
insulting
him
is
it
true
that
you
told
your
within
an
hour
of
her
acceptance
that
what
pleased
you
most
wa
that
she
wa
a
beggar
because
it
wa
better
to
raise
a
wife
from
poverty
so
that
you
may
have
complete
control
over
her
and
reproach
her
with
your
being
her
benefactor
upon
my
word
luzhin
cried
wrathfully
and
irritably
crimson
with
confusion
to
distort
my
word
in
this
way
excuse
me
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
the
report
which
ha
reached
you
or
rather
let
me
say
ha
been
conveyed
to
you
ha
no
foundation
in
truth
and
i
suspect
who
in
a
word
this
arrow
in
a
word
your
mamma
she
seemed
to
me
in
other
thing
with
all
her
excellent
quality
of
a
somewhat
and
romantic
way
of
thinking
but
i
wa
a
thousand
mile
from
supposing
that
she
would
misunderstand
and
misrepresent
thing
in
so
fanciful
a
way
and
indeed
indeed
i
tell
you
what
cried
raskolnikov
raising
himself
on
his
pillow
and
fixing
his
piercing
glittering
eye
upon
him
i
tell
you
what
luzhin
stood
still
waiting
with
a
defiant
and
offended
face
silence
lasted
for
some
second
why
if
ever
again
you
dare
to
mention
a
single
word
about
my
mother
i
shall
send
you
flying
downstairs
what
s
the
matter
with
you
cried
razumihin
so
that
s
how
it
is
luzhin
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lip
let
me
tell
you
sir
he
began
deliberately
doing
his
utmost
to
restrain
himself
but
breathing
hard
at
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
you
were
to
me
but
i
remained
here
on
purpose
to
find
out
more
i
could
forgive
a
great
deal
in
a
sick
man
and
a
connection
but
you
never
after
this
i
am
not
ill
cried
raskolnikov
so
much
the
worse
go
to
hell
but
luzhin
wa
already
leaving
without
finishing
his
speech
squeezing
between
the
table
and
the
chair
razumihin
got
up
this
time
to
let
him
pas
without
glancing
at
anyone
and
not
even
nodding
to
zossimov
who
had
for
some
time
been
making
sign
to
him
to
let
the
sick
man
alone
he
went
out
lifting
his
hat
to
the
level
of
his
shoulder
to
avoid
crushing
it
a
he
stooped
to
go
out
of
the
door
and
even
the
curve
of
his
spine
wa
expressive
of
the
horrible
insult
he
had
received
how
could
you
how
could
you
razumihin
said
shaking
his
head
in
perplexity
let
me
alone
let
me
alone
all
of
you
raskolnikov
cried
in
a
frenzy
will
you
ever
leave
off
tormenting
me
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
am
not
afraid
of
anyone
anyone
now
get
away
from
me
i
want
to
be
alone
alone
alone
come
along
said
zossimov
nodding
to
razumihin
but
we
can
t
leave
him
like
this
come
along
zossimov
repeated
insistently
and
he
went
out
razumihin
thought
a
minute
and
ran
to
overtake
him
it
might
be
worse
not
to
obey
him
said
zossimov

no
interest
in

seems
excited

i
noticed
that

through
nastasya
raskolnikov
left
alone
looked
with
impatience
and
misery
at
nastasya
but
she
still
lingered
won
t
you
have
some
tea
now
she
asked
later
i
am
sleepy
leave
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
wall
nastasya
went
out
chapter
vi
but
a
soon
a
she
went
out
he
got
up
latched
the
door
undid
the
parcel
which
razumihin
had
brought
in
that
evening
and
had
tied
up
again
and
began
dressing
strange
to
say
he
seemed
immediately
to
have
become
perfectly
calm
not
a
trace
of
his
recent
delirium
nor
of
the
panic
fear
that
had
haunted
him
of
late
it
wa
the
first
moment
of
a
strange
sudden
calm
his
movement
were
precise
and
definite
a
firm
purpose
wa
evident
in
them
he
muttered
to
himself
he
understood
that
he
wa
still
weak
but
his
intense
spiritual
concentration
gave
him
strength
and
he
hoped
moreover
that
he
would
not
fall
down
in
the
street
when
he
had
dressed
in
entirely
new
clothes
he
looked
at
the
money
lying
on
the
table
and
after
a
moment
s
thought
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
wa
rouble
he
took
also
all
the
copper
change
from
the
ten
rouble
spent
by
razumihin
on
the
clothes
then
he
softly
unlatched
the
door
went
out
slipped
downstairs
and
glanced
in
at
the
open
kitchen
door
nastasya
wa
standing
with
her
back
to
him
blowing
up
the
landlady
s
samovar
she
heard
nothing
who
would
have
dreamed
of
his
going
out
indeed
a
minute
later
he
wa
in
the
street
it
wa
nearly
eight
o
clock
the
sun
wa
setting
it
wa
a
stifling
a
before
but
he
eagerly
drank
in
the
stinking
dusty
town
air
his
head
felt
rather
dizzy
a
sort
of
savage
energy
gleamed
suddenly
in
his
feverish
eye
and
his
wasted
pale
and
yellow
face
he
did
not
know
and
did
not
think
where
he
wa
going
he
had
one
thought
only
that
all
must
be
ended
once
for
all
immediately
that
he
would
not
return
home
without
it
because
he
not
go
on
living
like
how
with
what
to
make
an
end
he
had
not
an
idea
about
it
he
did
not
even
want
to
think
of
it
he
drove
away
thought
thought
tortured
him
all
he
knew
all
he
felt
wa
that
everything
must
be
changed
one
way
or
another
he
repeated
with
desperate
and
immovable
and
determination
from
old
habit
he
took
his
usual
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
hay
market
a
young
man
with
a
barrel
organ
wa
standing
in
the
road
in
front
of
a
little
general
shop
and
wa
grinding
out
a
very
sentimental
song
he
wa
accompanying
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
stood
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
him
she
wa
dressed
up
in
a
crinoline
a
mantle
and
a
straw
hat
with
a
feather
in
it
all
very
old
and
shabby
in
a
strong
and
rather
agreeable
voice
cracked
and
coarsened
by
street
singing
she
sang
in
hope
of
getting
a
copper
from
the
shop
raskolnikov
joined
two
or
three
listener
took
out
a
five
copeck
piece
and
put
it
in
the
girl
s
hand
she
broke
off
abruptly
on
a
sentimental
high
note
shouted
sharply
to
the
organ
grinder
come
on
and
both
moved
on
to
the
next
shop
do
you
like
street
music
said
raskolnikov
addressing
a
man
standing
idly
by
him
the
man
looked
at
him
startled
and
wondering
i
love
to
hear
singing
to
a
street
organ
said
raskolnikov
and
his
manner
seemed
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
the
subject
i
like
it
on
cold
dark
damp
autumn
evening
they
must
be
damp
when
all
the
have
pale
green
sickly
face
or
better
still
when
wet
snow
is
falling
straight
down
when
there
s
no
wind
you
know
what
i
mean
and
the
street
lamp
shine
through
it
i
don
t
know
excuse
me
muttered
the
stranger
frightened
by
the
question
and
raskolnikov
s
strange
manner
and
he
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
raskolnikov
walked
straight
on
and
came
out
at
the
corner
of
the
hay
market
where
the
huckster
and
his
wife
had
talked
with
lizaveta
but
they
were
not
there
now
recognising
the
place
he
stopped
looked
round
and
addressed
a
young
fellow
in
a
red
shirt
who
stood
gaping
before
a
corn
chandler
s
shop
isn
t

a
man
who

a
booth

corner

of
people

answered
the
young
man
glancing
superciliously
at
raskolnikov
what

his
name
what
he
wa
aren
t
you

zaraïsky
man

the
young
man
looked
at
raskolnikov
again
it
s
not
a
province
your
excellency
but
a
district
graciously
forgive

raskolnikov
crossed
the
square
in
that
corner
there
wa
a
dense
crowd
of
peasant
he
pushed
his
way
into
the
thickest
part
of
it
looking
at
the
face
he
felt
an
unaccountable
inclination
to
enter
into
conversation
with
people
but
the
peasant
took
no
notice
of
him
they
were
all
shouting
in
group
together
he
stood
and
thought
a
little
and
took
a
turning
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
he
had
often
crossed
that
little
street
which
turn
at
an
angle
leading
from
the
to
sadovy
street
of
late
he
had
often
felt
drawn
to
wander
about
this
district
when
he
felt
depressed
that
he
might
feel
more
so
now
he
walked
along
thinking
of
nothing
at
that
point
there
is
a
great
block
of
building
entirely
let
out
in
dram
shop
and
woman
were
continually
running
in
and
out
and
in
their
indoor
clothes
here
and
there
they
gathered
in
group
on
the
pavement
especially
about
the
entrance
to
various
festive
establishment
in
the
lower
storey
from
one
of
these
a
loud
din
sound
of
singing
the
tinkling
of
a
guitar
and
shout
of
merriment
floated
into
the
street
a
crowd
of
woman
were
thronging
round
the
door
some
were
sitting
on
the
step
others
on
the
pavement
others
were
standing
talking
a
drunken
soldier
smoking
a
cigarette
wa
walking
near
them
in
the
road
swearing
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
find
his
way
somewhere
but
had
forgotten
where
one
beggar
wa
quarrelling
with
another
and
a
man
dead
drunk
wa
lying
right
across
the
road
raskolnikov
joined
the
throng
of
woman
who
were
talking
in
husky
voice
they
were
and
wore
cotton
dress
and
goatskin
shoe
there
were
woman
of
forty
and
some
not
more
than
seventeen
almost
all
had
blackened
eye
he
felt
strangely
attracted
by
the
singing
and
all
the
noise
and
uproar
in
the
saloon
below
someone
could
be
heard
within
dancing
frantically
marking
time
with
his
heel
to
the
sound
of
the
guitar
and
of
a
thin
falsetto
voice
singing
a
jaunty
air
he
listened
intently
gloomily
and
dreamily
bending
down
at
the
entrance
and
peeping
inquisitively
in
from
the
pavement
oh
my
handsome
soldier
don
t
beat
me
for
nothing
trilled
the
thin
voice
of
the
singer
raskolnikov
felt
a
great
desire
to
make
out
what
he
wa
singing
a
though
everything
depended
on
that
shall
i

t

come
in
one
of
the
woman
asked
him
her
voice
wa
still
musical
and
less
thick
than
the
others
she
wa
young
and
not
repulsive
the
only
one
of
the
group
why

pretty
he
said
drawing
himself
up
and
looking
at
her
she
smiled
much
pleased
at
the
compliment

she
said

a
tipsy
peasant
with
a
sly
smile
on
his
face
wearing
a
loose
coat
see
how
jolly
they
go
along
with
you
i

and
he
darted
down
into
the
saloon
below
raskolnikov
moved
on
i
say
sir
the
girl
shouted
after
him
what

she
hesitated

looked
curiously
at
the
speaker
she
wa
a
wench
of
thirty
covered
with
bruise
with
her
upper
lip
swollen
she
made
her
criticism
quietly
and
earnestly
where
is
it
thought
raskolnikov
where
is
it
i
ve
read
that
someone
condemned
to
death
say
or
think
an
hour
before
his
death
that
if
he
had
to
live
on
some
high
rock
on
such
a
narrow
ledge
that
he
d
only
room
to
stand
and
the
ocean
everlasting
darkness
everlasting
solitude
everlasting
tempest
around
him
if
he
had
to
remain
standing
on
a
square
yard
of
space
all
his
life
a
thousand
year
eternity
it
were
better
to
live
so
than
to
die
at
once
only
to
live
to
live
and
live
life

it
may
be

at
last
what
he
wa
seeking
and
began
to
read
it
the
line
danced
before
his
eye
but
he
read
it
all
and
began
eagerly
seeking
later
addition
in
the
following
number
his
hand
shook
with
nervous
impatience
a
he
turned
the
sheet
suddenly
someone
sat
down
beside
him
at
his
table
he
looked
up
it
wa
the
head
clerk
zametov
looking
just
the
same
with
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
the
with
the
curly
black
hair
parted
and
pomaded
with
the
smart
waistcoat
rather
shabby
coat
and
doubtful
linen
he
wa
in
a
good
humour
at
least
he
wa
smiling
very
gaily
and
his
dark
face
wa
rather
flushed
from
the
champagne
he
had
drunk
what
you
here
he
began
in
surprise
speaking
a
though
he
d
known
him
all
his
life
why
razumihin
told
me
only
yesterday
you
were
unconscious
how
strange
and
do
you
know
i
ve
been
to
see
you
raskolnikov
knew
he
would
come
up
to
him
he
laid
aside
the
paper
and
turned
to
zametov
there
wa
a
smile
on
his
lip
and
a
new
shade
of
irritable
impatience
wa
apparent
in
that
smile
i
know
you
have
he
answered
i
ve
heard
it
you
looked
for
my
sock
and
you
know
razumihin
ha
lost
his
heart
to
you
he
say
you
ve
been
with
him
to
luise
ivanovna
s
you
know
the
woman
you
tried
to
befriend
for
whom
you
winked
to
the
explosive
lieutenant
and
he
would
not
understand
do
you
remember
how
could
he
fail
to
understand
it
wa
quite
clear
wasn
t
it
what
a
hot
head
he
is
the
explosive
one
no

friend

must
have
a
jolly
life
zametov

free
to
the
most
agreeable
place
who
s
been
pouring
champagne
into
you
just
now
we
ve
just
been
having
a
drink
together

talk
about
pouring
it
into
me
by
way
of
a
fee
you
profit
by
everything
raskolnikov
laughed
it
s
all
right
my
dear
boy
he
added
slapping
zametov
on
the
shoulder
i
am
not
speaking
from
temper
but
in
a
friendly
way
for
sport
a
that
workman
of
yours
said
when
he
wa
scuffling
with
dmitri
in
the
case
of
the
old
woman
how
do
you
know
about
it
perhaps
i
know
more
about
it
than
you
how
strange
you
are
i
am
sure
you
are
still
very
unwell
you
oughtn
t
to
have
come

strange

paper

a
lot
about
the

about
the
here
he
looked
mysteriously
at
zametov
his
lip
were
twisted
again
in
a
mocking
smile
no
i
am
not
reading
about
the
fire
he
went
on
winking
at
zametov
but
confess
now
my
dear
fellow
you
re
awfully
anxious
to
know
what
i
am
reading
about
i
am
not
in
the
least
mayn
t
i
ask
a
question
why
do
you
keep
on
listen
you
are
a
man
of
culture
and
education
i
wa
in
the
sixth
class
at
the
gymnasium
said
zametov
with
some
dignity
sixth
class
ah
my
with
your
parting
and
your
ring
you
are
a
gentleman
of
fortune
foo
what
a
charming
boy
here
raskolnikov
broke
into
a
nervous
laugh
right
in
zametov
s
face
the
latter
drew
back
more
amazed
than
offended
foo
how
strange
you
are
zametov
repeated
very
seriously
i
can
t
help
thinking
you
are
still
i
am
delirious
you
are
fibbing
my
so
i
am
strange
you
find
me
curious
do
you
yes
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
wa
reading
about
what
i
wa
looking
for
see
what
a
lot
of
paper
i
ve
made
them
bring
me
suspicious
eh
well
what
is
it
you
prick
up
your
ear
how
do
you
mean
prick
up
my
ear
i
ll
explain
that
afterwards
but
now
my
boy
i
declare
to
you
no
better
i
confess
no
that
s
not
right
either
i
make
a
deposition
and
you
take
i
depose
that
i
wa
reading
that
i
wa
looking
and
searching
he
screwed
up
his
eye
and
paused
i
wa
searching
and
came
here
on
purpose
to
do
it
for
news
of
the
murder
of
the
old
pawnbroker
woman
he
articulated
at
last
almost
in
a
whisper
bringing
his
face
exceedingly
close
to
the
face
of
zametov
zametov
looked
at
him
steadily
without
moving
or
drawing
his
face
away
what
struck
zametov
afterwards
a
the
strangest
part
of
it
all
wa
that
silence
followed
for
exactly
a
minute
and
that
they
gazed
at
one
another
all
the
while
what
if
you
have
been
reading
about
it
he
cried
at
last
perplexed
and
impatient
that
s
no
business
of
mine
what
of
it
the
same
old
woman
raskolnikov
went
on
in
the
same
whisper
not
heeding
zametov
s
explanation
about
whom
you
were
talking
in
the
you
remember
when
i
fainted
well
do
you
understand
now
what
do
you
mean
understand
what
zametov
brought
out
almost
alarmed
raskolnikov
s
set
and
earnest
face
wa
suddenly
transformed
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
the
same
nervous
laugh
a
before
a
though
utterly
unable
to
restrain
himself
and
in
one
flash
he
recalled
with
extraordinary
vividness
of
sensation
a
moment
in
the
recent
past
that
moment
when
he
stood
with
the
axe
behind
the
door
while
the
latch
trembled
and
the
men
outside
swore
and
shook
it
and
he
had
a
sudden
desire
to
shout
at
them
to
swear
at
them
to
put
out
his
tongue
at
them
to
mock
them
to
laugh
and
laugh
and
laugh
you
are
either
mad
or
began
zametov
and
he
broke
off
a
though
stunned
by
the
idea
that
had
suddenly
flashed
into
his
mind
or
or
what
what
come
tell
me
nothing
said
zametov
getting
angry
it
s
all
nonsense
both
were
silent
after
his
sudden
fit
of
laughter
raskolnikov
became
suddenly
thoughtful
and
melancholy
he
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
he
seemed
to
have
completely
forgotten
zametov
the
silence
lasted
for
some
time
why
don
t
you
drink
your
tea
it
s
getting
cold
said
zametov
what
tea
oh
yes
raskolnikov
sipped
the
glass
put
a
morsel
of
bread
in
his
mouth
and
suddenly
looking
at
zametov
seemed
to
remember
everything
and
pulled
himself
together
at
the
same
moment
his
face
resumed
it
original
mocking
expression
he
went
on
drinking
tea
there
have
been
a
great
many
of
these
crime
lately
said
zametov
only
the
other
day
i
read
in
the
that
a
whole
gang
of
false
coiner
had
been
caught
in
moscow
it
wa
a
regular
society
they
used
to
forge
ticket
oh
but
it
wa
a
long
time
ago
i
read
about
it
a
month
ago
raskolnikov
answered
calmly
so
you
consider
them
criminal
he
added
smiling
of
course
they
are
they
they
are
child
simpleton
not
criminal
why
half
a
hundred
people
meeting
for
such
an
object
what
an
idea
three
would
be
too
many
and
then
they
want
to
have
more
faith
in
one
another
than
in
themselves
one
ha
only
to
blab
in
his
cup
and
it
all
collapse
simpleton
they
engaged
untrustworthy
people
to
change
the
note
what
a
thing
to
trust
to
a
casual
stranger
well
let
u
suppose
that
these
simpleton
succeed
and
each
make
a
million
and
what
follows
for
the
rest
of
their
life
each
is
dependent
on
the
others
for
the
rest
of
his
life
better
hang
oneself
at
once
and
they
did
not
know
how
to
change
the
note
either
the
man
who
changed
the
note
took
five
thousand
rouble
and
his
hand
trembled
he
counted
the
first
four
thousand
but
did
not
count
the
fifth
thousand
he
wa
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
the
money
into
his
pocket
and
run
away
of
course
he
roused
suspicion
and
the
whole
thing
came
to
a
crash
through
one
fool
is
it
possible
that
his
hand
trembled
observed
zametov
yes
that
s
quite
possible
that
i
feel
quite
sure
is
possible
sometimes
one
can
t
stand
can
t
stand
that
why
could
you
stand
it
then
no
i
couldn
t
for
the
sake
of
a
hundred
rouble
to
face
such
a
terrible
experience
to
go
with
false
note
into
a
bank
where
it
s
their
business
to
spot
that
sort
of
thing
no
i
should
not
have
the
face
to
do
it
would
you
raskolnikov
had
an
intense
desire
again
to
put
his
tongue
shiver
kept
running
down
his
spine
i
should
do
it
quite
differently
raskolnikov
began
this
is
how
i
would
change
the
note
i
d
count
the
first
thousand
three
or
four
time
backwards
and
forward
looking
at
every
note
and
then
i
d
set
to
the
second
thousand
i
d
count
that
through
and
then
hold
some
note
to
the
light
then
turn
it
then
hold
it
to
the
light
again
to
see
whether
it
wa
a
good
one
i
am
afraid
i
would
say
a
relation
of
mine
lost
rouble
the
other
day
through
a
false
note
and
then
i
d
tell
them
the
whole
story
and
after
i
began
counting
the
third
no
excuse
me
i
would
say
i
fancy
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
seventh
hundred
in
that
second
thousand
i
am
not
and
so
i
would
give
up
the
third
thousand
and
go
back
to
the
second
and
so
on
to
the
end
and
when
i
had
finished
i
d
pick
out
one
from
the
fifth
and
one
from
the
second
thousand
and
take
them
again
to
the
light
and
ask
again
change
them
please
and
put
the
clerk
into
such
a
stew
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
get
rid
of
me
when
i
d
finished
and
had
gone
out
i
d
come
back
no
excuse
me
and
ask
for
some
explanation
that
s
how
i
d
do
foo
what
terrible
thing
you
say
said
zametov
laughing
but
all
that
is
only
talk
i
dare
say
when
it
came
to
deed
you
d
make
a
slip
i
believe
that
even
a
practised
desperate
man
can
not
always
reckon
on
himself
much
less
you
and
i
to
take
an
example
near
home
that
old
woman
murdered
in
our
district
the
murderer
seems
to
have
been
a
desperate
fellow
he
risked
everything
in
open
daylight
wa
saved
by
a
miracle
but
his
hand
shook
too
he
did
not
succeed
in
robbing
the
place
he
couldn
t
stand
it
that
wa
clear
from
the
raskolnikov
seemed
offended
clear
why
don
t
you
catch
him
then
he
cried
maliciously
gibing
at
zametov
well
they
will
catch
who
you
do
you
suppose
you
could
catch
him
you
ve
a
tough
job
a
great
point
for
you
is
whether
a
man
is
spending
money
or
not
if
he
had
no
money
and
suddenly
begin
spending
he
must
be
the
man
so
that
any
child
can
mislead
the
fact
is
they
always
do
that
though
answered
zametov
a
man
will
commit
a
clever
murder
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
then
at
once
he
go
drinking
in
a
tavern
they
are
caught
spending
money
they
are
not
all
a
cunning
a
you
are
you
wouldn
t
go
to
a
tavern
of
course
raskolnikov
frowned
and
looked
steadily
at
zametov
you
seem
to
enjoy
the
subject
and
would
like
to
know
how
i
should
behave
in
that
case
too
he
asked
with
displeasure
i
should
like
to
zametov
answered
firmly
and
seriously
somewhat
too
much
earnestness
began
to
appear
in
his
word
and
look
very
much
very
much
all
right
then
this
is
how
i
should
behave
raskolnikov
began
again
bringing
his
face
close
to
zametov
s
again
staring
at
him
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
so
that
the
latter
positively
shuddered
this
is
what
i
should
have
done
i
should
have
taken
the
money
and
jewel
i
should
have
walked
out
of
there
and
have
gone
straight
to
some
deserted
place
with
fence
round
it
and
scarcely
anyone
to
be
seen
some
kitchen
garden
or
place
of
that
sort
i
should
have
looked
out
beforehand
some
stone
weighing
a
hundredweight
or
more
which
had
been
lying
in
the
corner
from
the
time
the
house
wa
built
i
would
lift
that
stone
there
would
sure
to
be
a
hollow
under
it
and
i
would
put
the
jewel
and
money
in
that
hole
then
i
d
roll
the
stone
back
so
that
it
would
look
a
before
would
press
it
down
with
my
foot
and
walk
away
and
for
a
year
or
two
three
maybe
i
would
not
touch
it
and
well
they
could
search
there
d
be
no
you
are
a
madman
said
zametov
and
for
some
reason
he
too
spoke
in
a
whisper
and
moved
away
from
raskolnikov
whose
eye
were
glittering
he
had
turned
fearfully
pale
and
his
upper
lip
wa
twitching
and
quivering
he
bent
down
a
close
a
possible
to
zametov
and
his
lip
began
to
move
without
uttering
a
word
this
lasted
for
half
a
minute
he
knew
what
he
wa
doing
but
could
not
restrain
himself
the
terrible
word
trembled
on
his
lip
like
the
latch
on
that
door
in
another
moment
it
will
break
out
in
another
moment
he
will
let
it
go
he
will
speak
out
and
what
if
it
wa
i
who
murdered
the
old
woman
and
lizaveta
he
said
suddenly
and
realised
what
he
had
done
zametov
looked
wildly
at
him
and
turned
white
a
the
tablecloth
his
face
wore
a
contorted
smile
but
is
it
possible
he
brought
out
faintly
raskolnikov
looked
wrathfully
at
him
own
up
that
you
believed
it
yes
you
did
not
a
bit
of
it
i
believe
it
less
than
ever
now
zametov
cried
hastily
i
ve
caught
my
so
you
did
believe
it
before
if
now
you
believe
less
than
ever
not
at
all
cried
zametov
obviously
embarrassed
have
you
been
frightening
me
so
a
to
lead
up
to
this
you
don
t
believe
it
then
what
were
you
talking
about
behind
my
back
when
i
went
out
of
the
and
why
did
the
explosive
lieutenant
question
me
after
i
fainted
hey
there
he
shouted
to
the
waiter
getting
up
and
taking
his
cap
how
much
thirty
copeck
the
latter
replied
running
up
and
there
is
twenty
copeck
for
vodka
see
what
a
lot
of
money
he
held
out
his
shaking
hand
to
zametov
with
note
in
it
red
note
and
blue
rouble
where
did
i
get
them
and
where
did
my
new
clothes
come
from
you
know
i
had
not
a
copeck
you
ve
my
landlady
i
ll
be
bound
well
that
s
enough
causé
till
we
meet
again
he
went
out
trembling
all
over
from
a
sort
of
wild
hysterical
sensation
in
which
there
wa
an
element
of
insufferable
rapture
yet
he
wa
gloomy
and
terribly
tired
his
face
wa
twisted
a
after
a
fit
his
fatigue
increased
rapidly
any
shock
any
irritating
sensation
stimulated
and
revived
his
energy
at
once
but
his
strength
failed
a
quickly
when
the
stimulus
wa
removed
zametov
left
alone
sat
for
a
long
time
in
the
same
place
plunged
in
thought
raskolnikov
had
unwittingly
worked
a
revolution
in
his
brain
on
a
certain
point
and
had
made
up
his
mind
for
him
conclusively
ilya
petrovitch
is
a
blockhead
he
decided
raskolnikov
had
hardly
opened
the
door
of
the
restaurant
when
he
stumbled
against
razumihin
on
the
step
they
did
not
see
each
other
till
they
almost
knocked
against
each
other
for
a
moment
they
stood
looking
each
other
up
and
down
razumihin
wa
greatly
astounded
then
anger
real
anger
gleamed
fiercely
in
his
eye
so
here
you
are
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
you
ran
away
from
your
bed
and
here
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
under
the
sofa
we
went
up
to
the
garret
i
almost
beat
nastasya
on
your
account
and
here
he
is
after
all
rodya
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
tell
me
the
whole
truth

to
death
of
you

and
i

raskolnikov
answered
calmly
alone
when
you
are
not
able
to
walk
when
your
face
is
a
white
a
a
sheet
and

are
gasping
for
breath

said
raskolnikov
and
tried
to
pas
him
this
wa
too
much
for
razumihin
he
gripped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulder
let
you
go
you

tell
me
to

razumihin
raskolnikov
began
quietly
apparently
calm
can
t
you
see
that
i
don
t
want
your
benevolence
a
strange
desire
you
have
to
shower
benefit
on
a
man
who
curse
them
who
feel
them
a
burden
in
fact
why
did
you
seek
me
out
at
the
beginning
of
my
illness
maybe
i
wa
very
glad
to
die
didn
t
i
tell
you
plainly
enough
that
you
were
torturing
me

seem
to
want
to
torture
people
i
assure
you
that

seriously
hindering
my
recovery
because
it

continually
irritating
me

saw
zossimov
went
away
just
now
to
avoid
irritating
me
you
leave
me
alone

for
goodness
sake
what
right
have
you
indeed
to
keep
me
by
force

t
you
see
that
i
am
in
possession
of
all
my
faculty

can
i
persuade
you
not

persecute
me
with
your
kindness

may
be
ungrateful

he
began
calmly
gloating
beforehand
over
the
venomous
phrase
he
wa
about
to
utter
but
finished
panting
for
breath
in
a
frenzy
a
he
had
been
with
luzhin
razumihin
stood
a
moment
thought
and
let
his
hand
drop
well
go
to
hell
then
he
said
gently
and
thoughtfully
stay
he
roared
a
raskolnikov
wa
about
to
move
listen
to
me
let
me
tell
you
that

set
of
babbling
posing
idiot
if
you

any
little
trouble
you
brood
over
it
like
a
hen
over
an
egg
and
you
are
plagiarist
even
in
that
there
isn
t

sign
of
independent
life
in

you
are
made
of
spermaceti
ointment
and

in
anyone
of
you
in
any
circumstance
the
first
thing
for
all
of
you
is
to

human
being

he
cried
with
redoubled
fury
noticing
that
raskolnikov
wa
again
making
a
movement

fool

out
of
patience
how

know

for
yourself
you
don

and
go
back
to
a
man
so
remember
potchinkov

house
on
the
third
storey
why
razumihin
i
do
believe

raskolnikov
turned
and
walked
away
i
bet
you
will
razumihin
shouted
after
him
i
refuse
to
know
you
if
you
don
t
stay
hey
is
zametov
in

did
you
see
him

to
him
what

you
don
t
tell
me
then
potchinkov
s
house
babushkin
s
flat
remember
raskolnikov
walked
on
and
turned
the
corner
into
sadovy
street
razumihin
looked
after
him
thoughtfully
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
went
into
the
house
but
stopped
short
of
the
stair
confound
it
he
went
on
almost
aloud
he
talked
sensibly
but
yet
i
am
a
fool
a
if
madman
didn
t
talk
sensibly
and
this
wa
just
what
zossimov
seemed
afraid
he
struck
his
finger
on
his
forehead
what
if
how
could
i
let
him
go
off
alone
he
may
drown
himself
ach
what
a
blunder
i
can
and
he
ran
back
to
overtake
raskolnikov
but
there
wa
no
trace
of
him
with
a
curse
he
returned
with
rapid
step
to
the
palais
de
cristal
to
question
zametov
raskolnikov
walked
straight
to
x
bridge
stood
in
the
middle
and
leaning
both
elbow
on
the
rail
stared
into
the
distance
on
parting
with
razumihin
he
felt
so
much
weaker
that
he
could
scarcely
reach
this
place
he
longed
to
sit
or
lie
down
somewhere
in
the
street
bending
over
the
water
he
gazed
mechanically
at
the
last
pink
flush
of
the
sunset
at
the
row
of
house
growing
dark
in
the
gathering
twilight
at
one
distant
attic
window
on
the
left
bank
flashing
a
though
on
fire
in
the
last
ray
of
the
setting
sun
at
the
darkening
water
of
the
canal
and
the
water
seemed
to
catch
his
attention
at
last
red
circle
flashed
before
his
eye
the
house
seemed
moving
the
the
canal
bank
the
carriage
all
danced
before
his
eye
suddenly
he
started
saved
again
perhaps
from
swooning
by
an
uncanny
and
hideous
sight
he
became
aware
of
someone
standing
on
the
right
side
of
him
he
looked
and
saw
a
tall
woman
with
a
kerchief
on
her
head
with
a
long
yellow
wasted
face
and
red
sunken
eye
she
wa
looking
straight
at
him
but
obviously
she
saw
nothing
and
recognised
no
one
suddenly
she
leaned
her
right
hand
on
the
parapet
lifted
her
right
leg
over
the
railing
then
her
left
and
threw
herself
into
the
canal
the
filthy
water
parted
and
swallowed
up
it
victim
for
a
moment
but
an
instant
later
the
drowning
woman
floated
to
the
surface
moving
slowly
with
the
current
her
head
and
leg
in
the
water
her
skirt
inflated
like
a
balloon
over
her
back

woman
drowning

of
voice

with

about

in
the
crowd
but
there
wa
no
need
of

a
policeman
ran
down
the
step
to
the
canal
threw
off
his
great
coat
and
his
boot
and
rushed
into
the
water
it
wa
easy
to
reach
her
she
floated
within
a
couple
of
yard
from
the
step
he
caught
hold
of
her
clothes
with
his
right
hand
and
with
his
left
seized
a
pole
which
a
comrade
held
out
to
him

drowning
woman

pulled
out
at

laid
her
on
the
granite
pavement
of
the
embankment
she
soon
recovered
consciousness
raised
her
head
sat
up
and
began
sneezing
and
coughing
stupidly
wiping
her
wet
dress
with
her
hand

said

side

out
to
the
shop
just
now
left
my
little
girl
to
look
after
her
and
here
she
s
in
trouble
again
a
neighbour
gentleman
a
neighbour
we
live
close
by
the
second
house
from
the
end
see
yonder
the
crowd
broke
up
the
police
still
remained
round
the
woman
someone
mentioned
the
police
station
raskolnikov
looked
on
with
a
strange
sensation
of
indifference
and
apathy
he
felt
disgusted
no
that
s
loathsome
water
it
s
not
good
enough
he
muttered
to
himself
nothing
will
come
of
it
he
added
no
use
to
wait
what
about
the
police
office
and
why
isn
t
zametov
at
the
police
office
the
police
office
is
open
till
ten
o
clock
he
turned
his
back
to
the
railing
and
looked
about
him
very
well
then
he
said
resolutely
he
moved
from
the
bridge
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
police
office
his
heart
felt
hollow
and
empty
he
did
not
want
to
think
even
his
depression
had
passed
there
wa
not
a
trace
now
of
the
energy
with
which
he
had
set
out
to
make
an
end
of
it
complete
apathy
had
succeeded
to
it
well
it
s
a
way
out
of
it
he
thought
walking
slowly
and
listlessly
along
the
canal
bank
anyway
i
ll
make
an
end
for
i
want
to
but
is
it
a
way
out
what
doe
it
matter
there
ll
be
the
square
yard
of
space
ha
but
what
an
end
is
it
really
the
end
shall
i
tell
them
or
not
ah
damn
how
tired
i
am
if
i
could
find
somewhere
to
sit
or
lie
down
soon
what
i
am
most
ashamed
of
is
it
being
so
stupid
but
i
don
t
care
about
that
either
what
idiotic
idea
come
into
one
s
to
reach
the
police
office
he
had
to
go
straight
forward
and
take
the
second
turning
to
the
left
it
wa
only
a
few
pace
away
but
at
the
first
turning
he
stopped
and
after
a
minute
s
thought
turned
into
a
side
street
and
went
two
street
out
of
his
way
possibly
without
any
object
or
possibly
to
delay
a
minute
and
gain
time
he
walked
looking
at
the
ground
suddenly
someone
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
ear
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
that
he
wa
standing
at
the
very
gate
of
house
he
had
not
passed
it
he
had
not
been
near
it
since
evening
an
overwhelming
unaccountable
prompting
drew
him
on
he
went
into
the
house
passed
through
the
gateway
then
into
the
first
entrance
on
the
right
and
began
mounting
the
familiar
staircase
to
the
fourth
storey
the
narrow
steep
staircase
wa
very
dark
he
stopped
at
each
landing
and
looked
round
him
with
curiosity
on
the
first
landing
the
framework
of
the
window
had
been
taken
out
that
wasn
t
so
then
he
thought
here
wa
the
flat
on
the
second
storey
where
nikolay
and
dmitri
had
been
working
it
s
shut
up
and
the
door
newly
painted
so
it
s
to
then
the
third
storey
and
the
fourth
here
he
wa
perplexed
to
find
the
door
of
the
flat
wide
open
there
were
men
there
he
could
hear
voice
he
had
not
expected
that
after
brief
hesitation
he
mounted
the
last
stair
and
went
into
the
flat
it
too
wa
being
done
up
there
were
workman
in
it
this
seemed
to
amaze
him
he
somehow
fancied
that
he
would
find
everything
a
he
left
it
even
perhaps
the
corps
in
the
same
place
on
the
floor
and
now
bare
wall
no
furniture
it
seemed
strange
he
walked
to
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
there
were
two
workman
both
young
fellow
but
one
much
younger
than
the
other
they
were
papering
the
wall
with
a
new
white
paper
covered
with
lilac
flower
instead
of
the
old
dirty
yellow
one
raskolnikov
for
some
reason
felt
horribly
annoyed
by
this
he
looked
at
the
new
paper
with
dislike
a
though
he
felt
sorry
to
have
it
all
so
changed
the
workman
had
obviously
stayed
beyond
their
time
and
now
they
were
hurriedly
rolling
up
their
paper
and
getting
ready
to
go
home
they
took
no
notice
of
raskolnikov
s
coming
in
they
were
talking

what

into

where
the
strong
box

bed
and
the
chest
of

looked
at
him
askance
what

asked

went
into
the
passage
and
pulled
the
bell
the
same
bell
the

cracked
note
he
rang
it
a
second
and
a
third
time
he
listened
and
remembered
the
hideous
and
agonisingly
fearful
sensation
he
had
felt
then
began
to
come
back
more
and
more
vividly
he
shuddered
at
every
ring
and
it
gave
him

and
more
satisfaction

looking
intently
into
the
darkening
street

standing
in
the
middle
of
the
thoroughfare
at
the
and
he
looked
about
him

though
expecting
from
someone
a
decisive
word
but
no
sound
came

silent
like
the
stone
on

he
walked
dead

at
once
at

went
up
to
the

he
seemed
to
clutch
at
everything
and
smiled
coldly
when
he
recognised
it
for
he
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
the

of
and
began
undressing
and
examining
him
she
kept
her
head
forgetting
herself
biting
her
trembling
lip
and
stifling
the
scream
which
were
ready
to

from

to

to
the
window

a
broken
chair

the
corner

large
earthenware
basin
full
of
water

in
readiness
for
washing

done
by

twice
a
week
if
not
oftener
for
the
family
had
come
to
such
a
pas
that
they
were
practically
without
change
of
linen
and
katerina
ivanovna
could
not
endure
uncleanliness
and
rather
than
see
dirt
in
the
house
she
preferred
to
wear
herself
out
at
night
working
beyond
her
strength
when
the
rest
were
asleep
so
a
to
get
the
wet
linen
hung
on
a
line
and
dry
by
the
morning
she
took
up
the
basin
of
water
at
raskolnikov
s
request
but
almost
fell
down
with
her
burden
but
the
latter
had
already
succeeded
in
finding
a
towel
wetted
it
and
began
washing
the
blood
off
marmeladov
s
face
katerina
ivanovna
stood
by
breathing
painfully
and
pressing
her
hand
to
her
breast
she
wa
in
need
of
attention
herself
raskolnikov
began
to
realise
that
he
might
have
made
a
mistake
in
having
the
injured
man
brought
here
the
policeman
too
stood
in
hesitation
polenka
cried
katerina
ivanovna

polenka
there
put
on
the
run
your
fastest
cried
the
little
boy
on
the
chair
suddenly
after
which
he
relapsed
into
the
same
dumb
rigidity
with
round
eye
his
heel
thrust
forward
and
his
toe
spread
out
meanwhile
the
room
had
become
so
full
of
people
that
you
couldn
t
have
dropped
a
pin
the
policeman
left
all
except
one
who
remained
for
a
time
trying
to
drive
out
the
people
who
came
in
from
the
stair
almost
all
madame
lippevechsel

lodger
had
streamed
in
from
the
inner
room
of
the
flat
at
first
they
were
squeezed
together
in
the
doorway
but
afterwards
they
overflowed
into
the
room
katerina
ivanovna
flew
into
a
fury
you
might
let
him
die
in
peace
at
least
she
shouted
at
the
crowd
is
it
a
spectacle
for
you
to
gape
at
with
cigarette
cough
cough
cough

might
a
well
keep
your
hat
on
and
there

in
his
hat
get
away
you
should
respect
the
dead
at
least
her
cough
choked
her
but
her
reproach
were
not
without
result
they
evidently
stood
in
some
awe
of
katerina
ivanovna
the
lodger
one
after
another
squeezed
back
into
the
doorway
with
that
strange
inner
feeling
of
satisfaction
which
may
be
observed
in
the
presence
of
a
sudden
accident
even
in
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
the
victim
from
which
no
living
man

cried
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
wa
rushing
to
the
door
to
vent
her
wrath
upon
them
but
in
the
doorway
came
face
to
face
with
madame
lippevechsel
who
had
only
just
heard
of
the
accident
and
ran
in
to
restore

haughty
tone
with
the
landlady
that

and

benefactor
to
him

had
many
friend
and
protector
whom
he
abandoned
himself
from
an
honourable
pride
knowing
his
unhappy
weakness
but
now
she
pointed
to
raskolnikov
a
generous
young
man
ha
come
to
our
assistance

wealth
and

and
whom

ha
known
from
a
child

may
rest
assured
amalia
ludwigovna
all
this
wa
uttered
with
extreme
rapidity
getting
quicker
and
quicker
but
a
cough
suddenly
cut
short
katerina
ivanovna
s
eloquence
at
that
instant
the
dying
man
recovered
consciousness
and
uttered
a
groan
she
ran
to
him
the
injured
man
opened
his
eye
and
without
recognition
or
understanding
gazed
at
raskolnikov
who
wa
bending
over
him
he
drew
deep
slow
painful
breath
blood
oozed
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
drop
of
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
not
recognising
raskolnikov
he
began
looking
round
uneasily
katerina
ivanovna
looked
at
him
with
a
sad
but
stern
face
and
tear
trickled
from
her
eye
my
god
his
whole
chest
is
crushed
how
he
is
bleeding
she
said
in
despair
we
must
take
off
his
clothes
turn
a
little
semyon
zaharovitch
if
you
can
she
cried
to
him
marmeladov
recognised
her
a
priest
he
articulated
huskily
katerina
ivanovna
walked
to
the
window
laid
her
head
against
the
window
frame
and
exclaimed
in
despair
oh
cursed
life
a
priest
the
dying
man
said
again
after
a
moment
s
silence
they
ve
gone
for
him
katerina
ivanovna
shouted
to
him
he
obeyed
her
shout
and
wa
silent
with
sad
and
timid
eye
he
looked
for
her
she
returned
and
stood
by
his
pillow
he
seemed
a
little
easier
but
not
for
long
soon
his
eye
rested
on
little
lida
his
favourite
who
wa
shaking
in
the
corner
a
though
she
were
in
a
fit
and
staring
at
him
with
her
wondering
childish
eye
he
signed
towards
her
uneasily
he
wanted
to
say
something
what
now
cried
katerina
ivanovna
barefoot
barefoot
he
muttered
indicating
with
frenzied
eye
the
child
s
bare
foot
be
silent
katerina
ivanovna
cried
irritably
you
know
why
she
is
thank
god
the
doctor
exclaimed
raskolnikov
relieved
the
doctor
came
in
a
precise
little
old
man
a
german
looking
about
him
mistrustfully
he
went
up
to
the
sick
man
took
his
pulse
carefully
felt
his
head
and
with
the
help
of
katerina
ivanovna
he
unbuttoned
the
shirt
and
bared
the
injured
man
s
chest
it
wa
gashed
crushed
and
fractured
several
rib
on
the
right
side
were
broken
on
the
left
side
just
over
the
heart
wa
a
large
bruise
a
cruel
kick
from
the
horse
s
hoof
the
doctor
frowned
the
policeman
told
him
that
he
wa
caught
in
the
wheel
and
turned
round
with
it
for
thirty
yard
on
the
road
it
s
wonderful
that
he
ha
recovered
consciousness
the
doctor
whispered
softly
to
raskolnikov
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
asked
he
will
die
is
there
really
no
hope
not
the
faintest
he
is
at
the
last
gasp
his
head
is
badly
injured
too
hm
i
could
bleed
him
if
you
like
but
it
would
be
useless
he
is
bound
to
die
within
the
next
five
or
ten
better
bleed
him
if
you
like
but
i
warn
you
it
will
be
perfectly
at
that
moment
other
step
were
heard
the
crowd
in
the
passage
parted
and
the
priest
a
little
grey
old
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
bearing
the
sacrament
a
policeman
had
gone
for
him
at
the
time
of
the
accident
the
doctor
changed
place
with
him
exchanging
glance
with
him
raskolnikov
begged
the
doctor
to
remain
a
little
while
he
shrugged
his
shoulder
and
remained
all
stepped
back
the
confession
wa
soon
over
the
dying
man
probably
understood
little
he
could
only
utter
indistinct
broken
sound
katerina
ivanovna
took
little
lida
lifted
the
boy
from
the
chair
knelt
down
in
the
corner
by
the
stove
and
made
the
child
kneel
in
front
of
her
the
little
girl
wa
still
trembling
but
the
boy
kneeling
on
his
little
bare
knee
lifted
his
hand
rhythmically
crossing
himself
with
precision
and
bowed
down
touching
the
floor
with
his
forehead
which
seemed
to
afford
him
especial
satisfaction
katerina
ivanovna
bit
her
lip
and
held
back
her
tear
she
prayed
too
now
and
then
pulling
straight
the
boy
s
shirt
and
managed
to
cover
the
girl
s
bare
shoulder
with
a
kerchief
which
she
took
from
the
chest
without
rising
from
her
knee
or
ceasing
to
pray
meanwhile
the
door
from
the
inner
room
wa
opened
inquisitively
again
in
the
passage
the
crowd
of
spectator
from
all
the
flat
on
the
staircase
grew
denser
and
denser
but
they
did
not
venture
beyond
the
threshold
a
single
lighted
up
the
scene
at
that
moment
polenka
forced
her
way
through
the
crowd
at
the
door
she
came
in
panting
from
running
so
fast
took
off
her
kerchief
looked
for
her
mother
went
up
to
her
and
said
she
s
coming
i
met
her
in
the
her
mother
made
her
kneel
beside
her
timidly
and
noiselessly
a
young
girl
made
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
strange
wa
her
appearance
in
that
room
in
the
midst
of
want
rag
death
and
despair
she
too
wa
in
rag
her
attire
wa
all
of
the
cheapest
but
decked
out
in
gutter
finery
of
a
special
stamp
unmistakably
betraying
it
shameful
purpose
sonia
stopped
short
in
the
doorway
and
looked
about
her
bewildered
unconscious
of
everything
she
forgot
her
gaudy
silk
dress
so
unseemly
here
with
it
ridiculous
long
train
and
her
immense
crinoline
that
filled
up
the
whole
doorway
and
her
shoe
and
the
parasol
she
brought
with
her
though
it
wa
no
use
at
night
and
the
absurd
round
straw
hat
with
it
flaring
feather
under
this
hat
wa
a
pale
frightened
little
face
with
lip
parted
and
eye
staring
in
terror
sonia
wa
a
small
thin
girl
of
eighteen
with
fair
hair
rather
pretty
with
wonderful
blue
eye
she
looked
intently
at
the
bed
and
the
priest
she
too
wa
out
of
breath
with
running
at
last
whisper
some
word
in
the
crowd
probably
reached
her
she
looked
down
and
took
a
step
forward
into
the
room
still
keeping
close
to
the
door
the
service
wa
over
katerina
ivanovna
went
up
to
her
husband
again
the
priest
stepped
back
and
turned
to
say
a
few
word
of
admonition
and
consolation
to
katerina
ivanovna
on
leaving
what
am
i
to
do
with
these
she
interrupted
sharply
and
irritably
pointing
to
the
little
one
god
is
merciful
look
to
the
most
high
for
succour
the
priest
began
ach
he
is
merciful
but
not
to
that
s
a
sin
a
sin
madam
observed
the
priest
shaking
his
head
and
isn
t
that
a
sin
cried
katerina
ivanovna
pointing
to
the
dying
man
perhaps
those
who
have
involuntarily
caused
the
accident
will
agree
to
compensate
you
at
least
for
the
loss
of
his
you
don
t
understand
cried
katerina
ivanovna
angrily
waving
her
hand
and
why
should
they
compensate
me
why
he
wa
drunk
and
threw
himself
under
the
horse
what
earnings
he
brought
u
in
nothing
but
misery
he
drank
everything
away
the
drunkard
he
robbed
u
to
get
drink
he
wasted
their
life
and
mine
for

and
thank
god
he
s
dying
one
less
to
keep

forgive
in
the
hour
of

that
s
a
sin
madam
such
feeling
are
a
great
katerina
ivanovna
wa
busy
with
the
dying
man
she
wa
giving
him
water
wiping
the
blood
and
sweat
from
his
head
setting
his
pillow
straight
and
had
only
turned
now
and
then
for
a
moment
to
address
the
priest
now
she
flew
at
him
almost
in
a
frenzy
ah
father
that
s
word
and
only
word
forgive
if
he
d
not
been
run
over
he
d
have
come
home
drunk
and
his
only
shirt
dirty
and
in
rag
and
he
d
have
fallen
asleep
like
a
log
and
i
should
have
been
sousing
and
rinsing
till
daybreak
washing
his
rag
and
the
child
s
and
then
drying
them
by
the
window
and
a
soon
a
it
wa
daylight
i
should
have
been
darning
them
that
s
how
i
spend
my
night
what
s
the
use
of
talking
of
forgiveness
i
have
forgiven
a
it
is
a
terrible
hollow
cough
interrupted
her
word
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
lip
and
showed
it
to
the
priest
pressing
her
other
hand
to
her
aching
chest
the
handkerchief
wa
covered
with
blood
the
priest
bowed
his
head
and
said
nothing
marmeladov
wa
in
the
last
agony
he
did
not
take
his
eye
off
the
face
of
katerina
ivanovna
who
wa
bending
over
him
again
he
kept
trying
to
say
something
to
her
he
began
moving
his
tongue
with
difficulty
and
articulating
indistinctly
but
katerina
ivanovna
understanding
that
he
wanted
to
ask
her
forgiveness
called
peremptorily
to
him
be
silent
no
need
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
and
the
sick
man
wa
silent
but
at
the
same
instant
his
wandering
eye
strayed
to
the
doorway
and
he
saw
sonia
till
then
he
had
not
noticed
her
she
wa
standing
in
the
shadow
in
a
corner
who
s
that
who
s
that
he
said
suddenly
in
a
thick
gasping
voice
in
agitation
turning
his
eye
in
horror
towards
the
door
where
his
daughter
wa
standing
and
trying
to
sit
up
lie
down
lie
cried
katerina
ivanovna
with
unnatural
strength
he
had
succeeded
in
propping
himself
on
his
elbow
he
looked
wildly
and
fixedly
for
some
time
on
his
daughter
a
though
not
recognising
her
he
had
never
seen
her
before
in
such
attire
suddenly
he
recognised
her
crushed
and
ashamed
in
her
humiliation
and
gaudy
finery
meekly
awaiting
her
turn
to
say
to
her
dying
father
his
face
showed
intense
suffering
sonia
daughter
forgive
he
cried
and
he
tried
to
hold
out
his
hand
to
her
but
losing
his
balance
he
fell
off
the
sofa
face
downwards
on
the
floor
they
rushed
to
pick
him
up
they
put
him
on
the
sofa
but
he
wa
dying
sonia
with
a
faint
cry
ran
up
embraced
him
and
remained
so
without
moving
he
died
in
her
arm
he
s
got
what
he
wanted
katerina
ivanovna
cried

her

up
to
katerina

began

and
circumstance

reverence
from

evening
when

to

and
how

loved
and

and
he
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
squeezing
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
stair
but
in
the
crowd
he
suddenly
jostled
against
nikodim
fomitch
who
had
heard
of
the
accident
and
had
come
to
give
instruction
in

not
met
since
the
scene
at
the
police
station
but
nikodim
fomitch
knew
him
instantly
ah
is
that
you
he
asked
him
he
s
dead
answered
raskolnikov
the
doctor
and
the
priest
have
been
all
a
it
should
have
been
don
t
worry
the
poor
woman
too
much
she
is
in
consumption
a
it
is
try
and
cheer
her
up
if
possible
you
are
a
man
i
know
he
added
with
a
smile
looking
straight
in
his
face
but
you
are
spattered
with
blood
observed
nikodim
fomitch
noticing
in
the
lamplight
some
fresh
stain
on
raskolnikov
s
waistcoat
yes
i
m
covered
with
blood
raskolnikov
said
with
a
peculiar
air
then
he
smiled
nodded
and
went
downstairs
he
walked
down
slowly
and
deliberately
feverish
but
not
conscious
of
it
entirely
absorbed
in
a
new
overwhelming
sensation
of
life
and
strength
that
surged
up
suddenly
within
him
this
sensation
might
be
compared
to
that
of
a
man
condemned
to
death
who
ha
suddenly
been
pardoned
halfway
down
the
staircase
he
wa
overtaken
by
the
priest
on
his
way
home
raskolnikov
let
him
pas
exchanging
a
silent
greeting
with
him
he
wa
just
descending
the
last
step
when
he
heard
rapid
footstep
behind
him
someone
overtook
him
it
wa
polenka
she
wa
running
after
him
calling
wait
wait
he
turned
round
she
wa
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
stopped
short
a
step
above
him
a
dim
light
came
in
from
the
yard
raskolnikov
could
distinguish
the
child
s
thin
but
pretty
little
face
looking
at
him
with
a
bright
childish
smile
she
had
run
after
him
with
a
message
which
she
wa
evidently
glad
to
give
tell
me
what
is
your
name
and
where
do
you
live
she
said
hurriedly
in
a
breathless
voice
he
laid
both
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
rapture
it
wa
such
a
joy
to
him
to
look
at
her
he
could
not
have
said
why
who
sent
you
sister
sonia
sent
me
answered
the
girl
smiling
still
more
brightly
i
knew
it
wa
sister
sonia
sent
mamma
sent
me
too
when
sister
sonia
wa
sending
me
mamma
came
up
too
and
said
run
fast
do
you
love
sister
sonia
i
love
her
more
than
anyone
polenka
answered
with
a
peculiar
earnestness
and
her
smile
became
graver
and
will
you
love
me
by
way
of
answer
he
saw
the
little
girl
s
face
approaching
him
her
full
lip
naïvely
held
out
to
kiss
him
suddenly
her
arm
a
thin
a
stick
held
him
tightly
her
head
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
the
little
girl
wept
softly
pressing
her
face
against
him
i
am
sorry
for
father
she
said
a
moment
later
raising
her
face
and
brushing
away
the
tear
with
her
hand
it
s
nothing
but
misfortune
now
she
added
suddenly
with
that
peculiarly
sedate
air
which
child
try
hard
to
assume
when
they
want
to
speak
like
people
did
your
father
love
you
he
loved
lida
most
she
went
on
very
seriously
without
a
smile
exactly
like
people
he
loved
her
because
she
is
little
and
because
she
is
ill
too
and
he
always
used
to
bring
her
present
but
he
taught
u
to
read
and
me
grammar
and
scripture
too
she
added
with
dignity
and
mother
never
used
to
say
anything
but
we
knew
that
she
liked
it
and
father
knew
it
too
and
mother
want
to
teach
me
french
for
it
s
time
my
education
and
do
you
know
your
prayer
of
course
we
do
we
knew
them
long
ago
i
say
my
prayer
to
myself
a
i
am
a
big
girl
now
but
kolya
and
lida
say
them
aloud
with
mother
first
they
repeat
the
ave
maria
and
then
another
prayer
lord
forgive
and
bless
sister
sonia
and
then
another
lord
forgive
and
bless
our
second
for
our
elder
father
is
dead
and
this
is
another
one
but
we
do
pray
for
the
other
a
polenka
my
name
is
rodion
pray
sometimes
for
me
too
and
thy
servant
rodion
nothing
i
ll
pray
for
you
all
the
rest
of
my
life
the
little
girl
declared
hotly
and
suddenly
smiling
again
she
rushed
at
him
and
hugged
him
warmly
once
more
raskolnikov
told
her
his
name
and
address
and
promised
to
be
sure
to
come
next
day
the
child
went
away
quite
enchanted
with
him
it
wa
past
ten
when
he
came
out
into
the
street
in
five
minute
he
wa
standing
on
the
bridge
at
the
spot
where
the
woman
had
jumped
in
enough
he
pronounced
resolutely
and
triumphantly
i
ve
done
with
fancy
imaginary
terror
and
phantom
life
is
real
haven
t
i
lived
just
now
my
life
ha
not
yet
died
with
that
old
woman
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
her
and
now
enough
madam
leave
me
in
peace
now
for
the
reign
of
reason
and
light
and
of
will
and
of
strength
and
now
we
will
see
we
will
try
our
strength
he
added
defiantly
a
though
challenging
some
power
of
darkness
and
i
wa
ready
to
consent
to
live
in
a
square
of
space
i
am
very
weak
at
this
moment
but
i
believe
my
illness
is
all
over
i
knew
it
would
be
over
when
i
went
out
by
the
way
potchinkov
s
house
is
only
a
few
step
away
i
certainly
must
go
to
razumihin
even
if
it
were
not
close
by
let
him
win
his
bet
let
u
give
him
some
satisfaction
too
no
matter
strength
strength
is
what
one
want
you
can
get
nothing
without
it
and
strength
must
be
won
by
strength
that
s
what
they
don
t
know
he
added
proudly
and
and
he
walked
with
flagging
footstep
from
the
bridge
pride
and
grew
continually
stronger
in
him
he
wa
becoming
a
different
man
every
moment
what
wa
it
had
happened
to
work
this
revolution
in
him
he
did
not
know
himself
like
a
man
catching
at
a
straw
he
suddenly
felt
that
he
too
could
live
that
there
wa
still
life
for
him
that
his
life
had
not
died
with
the
old
perhaps
he
wa
in
too
great
a
hurry
with
his
conclusion
but
he
did
not
think
of
that
but
i
did
ask
her
to
remember
thy
servant
rodion
in
her
prayer
the
idea
struck
him
well
that
wa
in
case
of
emergency
he
added
and
laughed
himself
at
his
boyish
sally
he
wa
in
the
best
of
spirit
he
easily
found
razumihin
the
new
lodger
wa
already
known
at
potchinkov
s
and
the
porter
at
once
showed
him
the
way
upstairs
he
could
hear
the
noise
and
animated
conversation
of
a
big
gathering
of
people
the
door
wa
wide
open
on
the
stair
he
could
hear
exclamation
and
discussion
razumihin
s
room
wa
fairly
large
the
company
consisted
of
fifteen
people
raskolnikov
stopped
in
the
entry
where
two
of
the
landlady
s
servant
were
busy
behind
a
screen
with
two
samovar
bottle
plate
and
dish
of
pie
and
savoury
brought
up
from
the
landlady
s
kitchen
raskolnikov
sent
in
for
razumihin
he
ran
out
delighted
at
the
first
glance
it
wa
apparent
that
he
had
had
a
great
deal
to
drink
and
though
no
amount
of
liquor
made
razumihin
quite
drunk
this
time
he
wa
perceptibly
affected
by
it
listen
raskolnikov
hastened
to
say
i
ve
only
just
come
to
tell
you
you
ve
won
your
bet
and
that
no
one
really
know
what
may
not
happen
to
him
i
can
t
come
in
i
am
so
weak
that
i
shall
fall
down
directly
and
so
good
evening
and
come
and
see
me
do
you
know
what
i
ll
see
you
home
if
you
say
you
re
weak
yourself
you
must
and
your
visitor
who
is
the
one
who
ha
just
peeped
out
he
goodness
only
know
some
friend
of
uncle
s
i
expect
or
perhaps
he
ha
come
without
being
invited
i
ll
leave
uncle
with
them
he
is
an
invaluable
person
pity
i
can
t
introduce
you
to
him
now
but
confound
them
all
now
they
won
t
notice
me
and
i
need
a
little
fresh
air
for
you
ve
come
just
in
the
nick
of
time
another
two
minute
and
i
should
have
come
to
blow
they
are
talking
such
a
lot
of
wild
stuff
you
simply
can
t
imagine
what
men
will
say
though
why
shouldn
t
you
imagine
don
t
we
talk
nonsense
ourselves
and
let
them
that
s
the
way
to
learn
not
to
wait
a
minute
i
ll
fetch
zossimov
pounced
upon
raskolnikov
almost
greedily
he
showed
a
special
interest
in
him
soon
his
face
brightened
you
must
go
to
bed
at
once
he
pronounced
examining
the
patient
a
far
a
he
could
and
take
something
for
the
night
will
you
take
it
i
got
it
ready
some
time
ago
a
two
if
you
like
answered
raskolnikov
the
powder
wa
taken
at
once
it
s
a
good
thing
you
are
taking
him
home
observed
zossimov
to
razumihin
we
shall
see
how
he
is
he
s
not
at
all
amiss
a
considerable
change
since
the
afternoon
live
and
learn
do
you
know
what
zossimov
whispered
to
me
when
we
were
coming
out
razumihin
blurted
out
a
soon
a
they
were
in
the
street
i
won
t
tell
you
everything
brother
because
they
are
such
fool
zossimov
told
me
to
talk
freely
to
you
on
the
way
and
get
you
to
talk
freely
to
me
and
afterwards
i
am
to
tell
him
about
it
for
he
s
got
a
notion
in
his
head
that
you
are
mad
or
close
on
it
only
fancy
in
the
first
place
you
ve
three
time
the
brain
he
ha
in
the
second
if
you
are
not
mad
you
needn
t
care
a
hang
that
he
ha
got
such
a
wild
idea
and
thirdly
that
piece
of
beef
whose
specialty
is
surgery
ha
gone
mad
on
mental
disease
and
what
s
brought
him
to
this
conclusion
about
you
wa
your
conversation
with
zametov
told
you
all
about
it
yes
and
he
did
well
now
i
understand
what
it
all
mean
and
so
doe
zametov
well
the
fact
is
rodya
the
point
is
i
am
a
little
drunk
now
but
that
s
no
matter
the
point
is
that
this
idea
you
understand
wa
just
being
hatched
in
their
brain
you
understand
that
is
no
one
ventured
to
say
it
aloud
because
the
idea
is
too
absurd
and
especially
since
the
arrest
of
that
painter
that
bubble
s
burst
and
gone
for
ever
but
why
are
they
such
fool
i
gave
zametov
a
bit
of
a
thrashing
at
the
time
that
s
between
ourselves
brother
please
don
t
let
out
a
hint
that
you
know
of
it
i
ve
noticed
he
is
a
ticklish
subject
it
wa
at
luise
ivanovna
s
but
it
s
all
cleared
up
that
ilya
petrovitch
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
took
advantage
of
your
fainting
at
the
police
station
but
he
is
ashamed
of
it
himself
now
i
know
that
raskolnikov
listened
greedily
razumihin
wa
drunk
enough
to
talk
too
freely
i
fainted
then
because
it
wa
so
close
and
the
smell
of
paint
said
raskolnikov
no
need
to
explain
that
and
it
wasn
t
the
paint
only
the
fever
had
been
coming
on
for
a
month
zossimov
testifies
to
that
but
how
crushed
that
boy
is
now
you
wouldn
t
believe
i
am
not
worth
his
little
finger
he
say
yours
he
mean
he
ha
good
feeling
at
time
brother
but
the
lesson
the
lesson
you
gave
him
in
the
palais
de
cristal
that
wa
too
good
for
anything
you
frightened
him
at
first
you
know
he
nearly
went
into
convulsion
you
almost
convinced
him
again
of
the
truth
of
all
that
hideous
nonsense
and
then
you
suddenly
put
out
your
tongue
at
him
there
now
what
do
you
make
of
it
it
wa
perfect
he
is
crushed
annihilated
now
it
wa
masterly
by
jove
it
s
what
they
deserve
ah
that
i
wasn
t
there
he
wa
hoping
to
see
you
awfully
porfiry
too

wa
that
only
that
subject
seemed
to
interest
you
now
it
s
clear
why
it
did
interest
you
knowing
all
the
circumstance
and
how
that
irritated
you
and
worked
in
with

illness

disease
but

for
half
a
minute
both
were
silent

razumihin
began
raskolnikov
i
want
to
tell
you
plainly
i
ve
just
been
at
a
a
clerk
who
died
i
gave
them
all
my
money
and
besides
i
ve
just
been
kissed
by
someone
who
if
i
had
killed
anyone
would
just
the
same
in
fact
i
saw
someone
else
there
with
a
feather
but
i
am
talking
nonsense
i
am
very
weak
support

be
at
the
stair
directly
what

the
matter
what
s
the
matter
with
you
razumihin
asked
anxiously
i
am
a
little
giddy
but
that
s
not
the
point
i
am
so
sad
so
sad
like
a
woman
look
what
s
that
look
look
what
is
it
don
t
you
see
a
light
in
my
room
you
see
through
the
crack
they
were
already
at
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
of
stair
at
the
level
of
the
landlady
s
door
and
they
could
a
a
fact
see
from
below
that
there
wa
a
light
in
raskolnikov
s
garret
queer
nastasya
perhaps
observed
razumihin
she
is
never
in
my
room
at
this
time
and
she
must
be
in
bed
long
ago
but
i
don
t
care
what
do
you
mean
i
am
coming
with
you
we
ll
come
in
together
i
know
we
are
going
in
together
but
i
want
to
shake
hand
here
and
say
to
you

me
your
hand
what
s
the
matter
with
you
rodya
nothing
come
along
you
shall
be
they
began
mounting
the
stair
and
the
idea
struck
razumihin
that
perhaps
zossimov
might
be
right
after
all
ah
i
ve
upset
him
with
my
chatter
he
muttered
to
himself
when
they
reached
the
door
they
heard
voice
in
the
room
what
is
it
cried
razumihin
raskolnikov
wa
the
first
to
open
the
door
he
flung
it
wide
and
stood
still
in
the
doorway
dumbfoundered
his
mother
and
sister
were
sitting
on
his
sofa
and
had
been
waiting
an
hour
and
a
half
for
him
why
had
he
never
expected
never
thought
of
them
though
the
news
that
they
had
started
were
on
their
way
and
would
arrive
immediately
had
been
repeated
to
him
only
that
day
they
had
spent
that
hour
and
a
half
plying
nastasya
with
question
she
wa
standing
before
them
and
had
told
them
everything
by
now
they
were
beside
themselves
with
alarm
when
they
heard
of
his
running
away
ill
and
a
they
understood
from
her
story
delirious
good
heaven
what
had
become
of
him
both
had
been
weeping
both
had
been
in
anguish
for
that
hour
and
a
half
a
cry
of
joy
of
ecstasy
greeted
raskolnikov
s
entrance
both
rushed
to
him
but
he
stood
like
one
dead
a
sudden
intolerable
sensation
struck
him
like
a
thunderbolt
he
did
not
lift
his
arm
to
embrace
them
he
could
not
his
mother
and
sister
clasped
him
in
their
arm
kissed
him
laughed
and
cried
he
took
a
step
tottered
and
fell
to
the
ground
fainting
anxiety
cry
of
horror
moan
razumihin
who
wa
standing
in
the
doorway
flew
into
the
room
seized
the
sick
man
in
his
strong
arm
and
in
a
moment
had
him
on
the
sofa
it
s
nothing
nothing
he
cried
to
the
mother
and
sister
it
s
only
a
faint
a
mere
trifle
only
just
now
the
doctor
said
he
wa
much
better
that
he
is
perfectly
well
water
see
he
is
coming
to
himself
he
is
all
right
again
and
seizing
dounia
by
the
arm
so
that
he
almost
dislocated
it
he
made
her
bend
down
to
see
that
he
is
all
right
the
mother
and
sister
looked
on
him
with
emotion
and
gratitude
a
their
providence
they
had
heard
already
from
nastasya
all
that
had
been
done
for
their
rodya
during
his
illness
by
this
very
competent
young
man
a
pulcheria
alexandrovna

called
him
that
evening
in
conversation
with

i
raskolnikov
got
up
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
he
waved
his
hand
weakly
to
razumihin
to
cut
short
the
flow
of
warm
and
incoherent
consolation
he
wa
addressing
to
his
mother
and
sister
took
them
both
by
the
hand
and
for
a
minute
or
two
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
without
speaking
his
mother
wa
alarmed
by
his
expression
it
revealed
an
emotion
agonisingly
poignant
and
at
the
same
time
something
immovable
almost
insane
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
to
cry
avdotya
romanovna
wa
pale
her
hand
trembled
in
her
brother
s
go
home
with
him
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
pointing
to
razumihin
till
everything
is
it
long
since
you
arrived
this
evening
rodya
answered
pulcheria
alexandrovna
the
train

awfully
late
but
rodya
nothing
would
induce
me
to
leave

will
spend
the
night
here

he
said
with
a
gesture
of
irritation
i
will
stay
with
him
cried
razumihin
i
won
t
leave
him
for
a
moment

all
my
visitor

pressing
razumihin

hand
but
raskolnikov
interrupted
her
again
i
can

it
i
can

have
it
he
repeated
irritably

can
t
stand
it
come
mamma
come
out

room

for
a
minute
dounia
whispered
in
dismay
we
are
distressing
him
that
s
mayn
t
i
look
at
him
after
three
year

pulcheria
alexandrovna

he
stopped
them
again
you
keep
interrupting
me
and
my
idea
get
muddled
have
you
seen
luzhin
no
rodya
but
he
know
already
of
our
arrival
we
have
heard
rodya
that
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
so
kind
a
to
visit
you
today
pulcheria
alexandrovna
added
somewhat
timidly
yes
he
wa
so
kind
dounia
i
promised
luzhin
i
d
throw
him
downstairs
and
told
him
to
go
to
hell
rodya
what
are
you
saying
surely
you
don
t
mean
to
tell
u
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
in
alarm
but
she
stopped
looking
at
dounia
avdotya
romanovna
wa
looking
attentively
at
her
brother
waiting
for
what
would
come
next
both
of
them
had
heard
of
the
quarrel
from
nastasya
so
far
a
she
had
succeeded
in
understanding
and
reporting
it
and
were
in
painful
perplexity
and
suspense
dounia
raskolnikov
continued
with
an
effort
i
don
t
want
that
marriage
so
at
the
first
opportunity
you
must
refuse
luzhin
so
that
we
may
never
hear
his
name
good
heaven
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
brother
think
what
you
are
saying
avdotya
romanovna
began
impetuously
but
immediately
checked
herself
you
are
not
fit
to
talk
now
perhaps
you
are
tired
she
added
gently
you
think
i
am
delirious
no
you
are
marrying
luzhin
for
sake
but
i
won
t
accept
the
sacrifice
and
so
write
a
letter
before
to
refuse
him
let
me
read
it
in
the
morning
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
that
i
can
t
do
the
girl
cried
offended
what
right
have
you
dounia
you
are
hasty
too
be
quiet
don
t
you
see
the
mother
interposed
in
dismay
better
come
away
he
is
raving
razumihin
cried
tipsily
or
how
would
he
dare
all
this
nonsense
will
be
over
he
certainly
did
drive
him
away
that
wa
so
and
luzhin
got
angry
too
he
made
speech
here
wanted
to
show
off
his
learning
and
he
went
out
then
it
s
true
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
till
brother
said
dounia
compassionately
let
u
go
mother
do
you
hear
sister
he
repeated
after
them
making
a
last
effort
i
am
not
delirious
this
marriage
is
an
infamy
let
me
act
like
a
scoundrel
but
you
mustn
t
one
is
enough
and
though
i
am
a
scoundrel
i
wouldn
t
own
such
a
sister
it
s
me
or
luzhin

now
but
you
re
out
of
your
mind
despot
roared
razumihin
but
raskolnikov
did
not
and
perhaps
could
not
answer
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
turned
to
the
wall
utterly
exhausted
avdotya
romanovna
looked
with
interest
at
razumihin
her
black
eye
flashed
razumihin
positively
started
at
her
glance
pulcheria
alexandrovna
stood
overwhelmed
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
she
whispered
in
despair
to
razumihin
i
will
stay
somewhere
here
escort
dounia
you
ll
spoil
everything
razumihin
answered
in
the
same
whisper
losing
patience
come
out
on
to
the
stair
anyway
nastasya
show
a
light
i
assure
you
he
went
on
in
a
half
whisper
on
the
stair
that
he
wa
almost
beating
the
doctor
and
me
this
afternoon
do
you
understand
the
doctor
himself
even
he
gave
way
and
left
him
so
a
not
to
irritate
him
i
remained
downstairs
on
guard
but
he
dressed
at
once
and
slipped
off
and
he
will
slip
off
again
if
you
irritate
him
at
this
time
of
night
and
will
do
himself
some
mischief
what
are
you
saying
and
avdotya
romanovna
can
t
possibly
be
left
in
those
lodging
without
you
just
think
where
you
are
staying
that
blackguard
pyotr
petrovitch
couldn
t
find
you
better
lodging
but
you
know
i
ve
had
a
little
to
drink
and
that
s
what
make
me
swear
don
t
mind
it
but
i
ll
go
to
the
landlady
here
pulcheria
alexandrovna
insisted
i
ll
beseech
her
to
find
some
corner
for
dounia
and
me
for
the
night
i
can
t
leave
him
like
that
i
can
not
this
conversation
took
place
on
the
landing
just
before
the
landlady
s
door
nastasya
lighted
them
from
a
step
below
razumihin
wa
in
extraordinary
excitement
half
an
hour
earlier
while
he
wa
bringing
raskolnikov
home
he
had
indeed
talked
too
freely
but
he
wa
aware
of
it
himself
and
his
head
wa
clear
in
spite
of
the
vast
quantity
he
had
imbibed
now
he
wa
in
a
state
bordering
on
ecstasy
and
all
that
he
had
drunk
seemed
to
fly
to
his
head
with
redoubled
effect
he
stood
with
the
two
lady
seizing
both
by
their
hand
persuading
them
and
giving
them
reason
with
astonishing
plainness
of
speech
and
at
almost
every
word
he
uttered
probably
to
emphasise
his
argument
he
squeezed
their
hand
painfully
a
in
a
vise
he
stared
at
avdotya
romanovna
without
the
least
regard
for
good
manner
they
sometimes
pulled
their
hand
out
of
his
huge
bony
paw
but
far
from
noticing
what
wa
the
matter
he
drew
them
all
the
closer
to
him
if
they
d
told
him
to
jump
head
foremost
from
the
staircase
he
would
have
done
it
without
thought
or
hesitation
in
their
service
though
pulcheria
alexandrovna
felt
that
the
young
man
wa
really
too
eccentric
and
pinched
her
hand
too
much
in
her
anxiety
over
her
rodya
she
looked
on
his
presence
a
providential
and
wa
unwilling
to
notice
all
his
peculiarity
but
though
avdotya
romanovna
shared
her
anxiety
and
wa
not
of
timorous
disposition
she
could
not
see
the
glowing
light
in
his
eye
without
wonder
and
almost
alarm
it
wa
only
the
unbounded
confidence
inspired
by
nastasya
s
account
of
her
brother
s
queer
friend
which
prevented
her
from
trying
to
run
away
from
him
and
to
persuade
her
mother
to
do
the
same
she
realised
too
that
even
running
away
wa
perhaps
impossible
now
ten
minute
later
however
she
wa
considerably
reassured
it
wa
characteristic
of
razumihin
that
he
showed
his
true
nature
at
once
whatever
mood

they
had
to

his
mother

to
a
frenzy

in
the
street

petersburg

awful
place
in
that
way
but
no
matter
then
i
ll
run
straight
back
here
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
on
my
word
of
honour
i
ll
bring
you
news
how
he
is
whether
he
is
asleep
and
all
that
then
listen
then
i
ll
run
home
in
a
twinkling
i
ve
a
lot
of
friend
there
all
drunk
i
ll
fetch
zossimov
that
s
the
doctor
who
is
looking
after
him
he
is
there
too
but
he
is
not
drunk
he
is
not
drunk
he
is
never
drunk
i
ll
drag
him
to
rodya
and
then
to
you
so
that
you
ll
get
two
report
in
the
hour
from
the
doctor
you
understand
from
the
doctor
himself
that
s
a
very
different
thing
from
my
account
of
him
if
there
s
anything
wrong
i
swear
i
ll
bring
you
here
myself
but
if
it
s
all
right
you
go
to
bed
and
i
ll
spend
the
night
here
in
the
passage
he
won
t
hear
me
and
i
ll
tell
zossimov
to
sleep
at
the
landlady
s
to
be
at
hand
which
is
better
for
him
you
or
the
doctor
so
come
home
then
but
the
landlady
is
out
of
the
question
it
s
all
right
for
me
but
it
s
out
of
the
question
for
you
she
wouldn
t
take
you
for
she
s
for
she
s
a
fool
she
d
be
jealous
on
my
account
of
avdotya
romanovna
and
of
you
too
if
you
want
to
know
of
avdotya
romanovna
certainly
she
is
an
absolutely
absolutely
unaccountable
character
but
i
am
a
fool
too
no
matter
come
along
do
you
trust
me
come
do
you
trust
me
or
not
let

mother
said
avdotya
romanovna
he
will
certainly
do
what
he
ha
promised
he
ha
saved
rodya
already
and
if
the
doctor
really
will
consent
to
spend
the
night
here
what
could
be
better
you
see
you
you
understand
me
because
you
are
an
angel
razumihin
cried
in
ecstasy
let
u
go
nastasya
fly
upstairs
and
sit
with
him
with
a
light
i
ll
come
in
a
quarter
of
an
though
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
not
perfectly
convinced
she
made
no
further
resistance
razumihin
gave
an
arm
to
each
and
drew
them
down
the
stair
he
still
made
her
uneasy
a
though
he
wa
competent
and
wa
he
capable
of
carrying
out
his
promise
he
seemed
in
such
a
condition
ah
i
see
you
think
i
am
in
such
a
condition
razumihin
broke
in
upon
her
thought
guessing
them
a
he
strolled
along
the
pavement
with
huge
step
so
that
the
two
lady
could
hardly
keep
up
with
him
a
fact
he
did
not
observe
however
nonsense
that
is
i
am
drunk
like
a
fool
but
that
s
not
it
i
am
not
drunk
from
wine
it
s
seeing
you
ha
turned
my
head
but
don
t
mind
me
don
t
take
any
notice
i
am
talking
nonsense
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
am
utterly
unworthy
of
you
the
minute
i
ve
taken
you
home
i
ll
pour
a
couple
of
pailful
of
water
over
my
head
in
the
gutter
here
and
then
i
shall
be
all
right
if
only
you
knew
how
i
love
you
both
don
t
laugh
and
don
t
be
angry
you
may
be
angry
with
anyone
but
not
with
me
i
am
his
friend
and
therefore
i
am
your
friend
too
i
want
to
be
i
had
a
presentiment
last
year
there
wa
a
moment
though
it
wasn
t
a
presentiment
really
for
you
seem
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
and
i
expect
i
shan
t
sleep
all
night
zossimov
wa
afraid
a
little
time
ago
that
he
would
go
mad
that
s
why
he
mustn
t
be
what
do
you
say
cried
the
mother
did
the
doctor
really
say
that
asked
avdotya
romanovna
alarmed
yes
but
it
s
not
so
not
a
bit
of
it
he
gave
him
some
medicine
a
powder
i
saw
it
and
then
your
coming
here
ah
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
come
it
s
a
good
thing
we
went
away
and
in
an
hour
zossimov
himself
will
report
to
you
about
everything
he
is
not
drunk
and
i
shan
t
be
drunk
and
what
made
me
get
so
tight
because
they
got
me
into
an
argument
damn
them
i
ve
sworn
never
to
argue
they
talk
such
trash
i
almost
came
to
blow
i
ve
left
my
uncle
to
preside
would
you
believe
they
insist
on
complete
absence
of
individualism
and
that
s
just
what
they
relish
not
to
be
themselves
to
be
a
unlike
themselves
a
they
can
that
s
what
they
regard
a
the
highest
point
of
progress
if
only
their
nonsense
were
their
own
but
a
it
is
listen
pulcheria
alexandrovna
interrupted
timidly
but
it
only
added
fuel
to
the
flame
what
do
you
think
shouted
razumihin
louder
than
ever
you
think
i
am
attacking
them
for
talking
nonsense
not
a
bit
i
like
them
to
talk
nonsense
that
s
man

one
privilege
over
all
creation
through
error
you
come
to
the
truth
i
am
a
man
because
i
err
you
never
reach
any
truth
without
making
fourteen
mistake
and
very
likely
a
hundred
and
fourteen
and
a
fine
thing
too
in
it
way
but
we
can
t
even
make
mistake
on
our
own
account
talk
nonsense
but
talk
your
own
nonsense
and
i
ll
kiss
you
for
it
to
go
wrong
in
one

better
than
to
go
right
in

avdotya
romanovna
earnestly
and
at
once
uttered
a
cry

not
worthy
to

haste
to
apologise
but
but
you
can
t
be
angry
with
me
for

when
he
came
in
that
that
man

not
of
our
sort
not
because
he
had
his
hair
curled
at
the
barber
s
not
because
he
wa
in
such
a
hurry
to
show
his
wit
but
because
he
is
a
spy
a
speculator
because

buffoon

and
i
do
too
yet
we
shall
talk
our
way
to
the
truth
at
last
for

pulcheria
alexandrovna
addressing
her
daughter
with
anxiety
and
dismay
don

worry
yourself
mother
said
dounia
taking
off
her
hat
and
cape
god
ha
sent
this
gentleman
to
our
aid
though
he
ha
come
from
a
drinking
party
we
can
depend
on
him
i
assure
you
and
all
that
he
ha
done
for
rodya
ah
dounia

whether
he
will
come
how
could
i
bring
myself
to
leave
rodya
and
how
different
how
different
i
had
fancied
our
meeting
how
sullen
he
wa
a
though
not
pleased
to
see
u
tear
came
into
her
eye
no
it
s
not
that
mother
you
didn
t
see
you
were
cry
all
the
time
he
is
quite
unhinged
by
serious
illness
that
s
the
ah
that
illness
what
will
happen
what
will
happen
and
how
he
talked
to
you
dounia
said
the
mother
looking
timidly
at
her
daughter
trying
to
read
her
thought
and
already
half
consoled
by
dounia
s
standing
up
for
her
brother
which
meant
that
she
had
already
forgiven
him
i
am
sure
he
will
think
better
of
it
she
added
probing
her
further
and
i
am
sure
that
he
will
say
the
same
about
that
avdotya
romanovna
said
finally
and
of
course
there
wa
no
going
beyond
that
for
this
wa
a
point
which
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
afraid
to
discus
dounia
went
up
and
kissed
her
mother
the
latter
warmly
embraced
her
without
speaking
then
she
sat
down
to
wait
anxiously
for
razumihin
s
return
timidly
watching
her
daughter
who
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
her
arm
folded
lost
in
thought
this
walking
up
and
down
when
she
wa
thinking
wa
a
habit
of
avdotya
romanovna
s
and
the
mother
wa
always
afraid
to
break
in
on
her
daughter
s
mood
at
such
moment
razumihin
of
course
wa
ridiculous
in
his
sudden
drunken
infatuation
for
avdotya
romanovna
yet
apart
from
his
eccentric
condition
many
people
would
have
thought
it
justified
if
they
had
seen
avdotya
romanovna
especially
at
that
moment
when
she
wa
walking
to
and
fro
with
folded
arm
pensive
and
melancholy
avdotya
romanovna
wa
remarkably
she
wa
tall
strikingly
strong
and
the
latter
quality
wa
apparent
in
every
gesture
though
it
did
not
in
the
least
detract
from
the
grace
and
softness
of
her
movement
in
face
she
resembled
her
brother
but
she
might
be
described
a
really
beautiful
her
hair
wa
dark
brown
a
little
lighter
than
her
brother
s
there
wa
a
proud
light
in
her
almost
black
eye
and
yet
at
time
a
look
of
extraordinary
kindness
she
wa
pale
but
it
wa
a
healthy
pallor
her
face
wa
radiant
with
freshness
and
vigour
her
mouth
wa
rather
small
the
full
red
lower
lip
projected
a
little
a
did
her
chin
it
wa
the
only
irregularity
in
her
beautiful
face
but
it
gave
it
a
peculiarly
individual
and
almost
haughty
expression
her
face
wa
always
more
serious
and
thoughtful
than
gay
but
how
well
smile
how
well
youthful
lighthearted
irresponsible
laughter
suited
her
face
it
wa
natural
enough
that
a
warm
open
honest
giant
like
razumihin
who
had
never
seen
anyone
like
her
and
wa
not
quite
sober
at
the
time
should
lose
his
head
immediately
besides
a
chance
would
have
it
he
saw
dounia
for
the
first
time
transfigured
by
her
love
for
her
brother
and
her
joy
at
meeting
him
afterwards
he
saw
her
lower
lip
quiver
with
indignation
at
her
brother
s
insolent
cruel
and
ungrateful
word
and
his
fate
wa
sealed
he
had
spoken
the
truth
moreover
when
he
blurted
out
in
his
drunken
talk
on
the
stair
that
praskovya
pavlovna
raskolnikov
s
eccentric
landlady
would
be
jealous
of
pulcheria
alexandrovna
a
well
a
of
avdotya
romanovna
on
his
account
although
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
her
face
still
retained
trace
of
her
former
beauty
she
looked
much
younger
than
her
age
indeed
which
is
almost
always
the
case
with
woman
who
retain
serenity
of
spirit
sensitiveness
and
pure
sincere
warmth
of
heart
to
old
age
we
may
add
in
parenthesis
that
to
preserve
all
this
is
the
only
mean
of
retaining
beauty
to
old
age
her
hair
had
begun
to
grow
grey
and
thin
there
had
long
been
little
crow
s
foot
wrinkle
round
her
eye
her
cheek
were
hollow
and
sunken
from
anxiety
and
grief
and
yet
it
wa
a
handsome
face
she
wa
dounia
over
again
twenty
year
older
but
without
the
projecting
underlip
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
emotional
but
not
sentimental
timid
and
yielding
but
only
to
a
certain
point
she
could
give
way
and
accept
a
great
deal
even
of
what
wa
contrary
to
her
conviction
but
there
wa
a
certain
barrier
fixed
by
honesty
principle
and
the
deepest
conviction
which
nothing
would
induce
her
to
cross
exactly
twenty
minute
after
razumihin
s
departure
there
came
two
subdued
but
hurried
knock
at
the
door
he
had
come
back
i
won
t
come
in
i
haven
t
time
he
hastened
to
say
when
the
door
wa
opened
he
sleep
like
a
top
soundly
quietly
and
god
grant
he
may
sleep
ten
hour
nastasya
s
with
him
i
told
her
not
to
leave
till
i
came
now
i
am
fetching
zossimov
he
will
report
to
you
and
then
you
d
better
turn
in
i
can
see
you
are
too
tired
to
do
anything
and
he
ran
off
down
the
corridor
what
a
very
competent
and
devoted
young
man
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
exceedingly
delighted
he
seems
a
splendid
person
avdotya
romanovna
replied
with
some
warmth
resuming
her
walk
up
and
down
the
room
it
wa
nearly
an
hour
later
when
they
heard
footstep
in
the
corridor
and
another
knock
at
the
door
both
woman
waited
this
time
completely
relying
on
razumihin
s
promise
he
actually
had
succeeded
in
bringing
zossimov
zossimov
had
agreed
at
once
to
desert
the
drinking
party
to
go
to
raskolnikov
s
but
he
came
reluctantly
and
with
the
greatest
suspicion
to
see
the
lady
mistrusting
razumihin
in
his
exhilarated
condition
but
his
vanity
wa
at
once
reassured
and
flattered
he
saw
that
they
were
really
expecting
him
a
an
oracle
he
stayed
just
ten
minute
and
succeeded
in
completely
convincing
and
comforting
pulcheria
alexandrovna
he
spoke
with
marked
sympathy
but
with
the
reserve
and
extreme
seriousness
of
a
young
doctor
at
an
important
consultation
he
did
not
utter
a
word
on
any
other
subject
and
did
not
display
the
slightest
desire
to
enter
into
more
personal
relation
with
the
two
lady
remarking
at
his
first
entrance
the
dazzling
beauty
of
avdotya
romanovna
he
endeavoured
not
to
notice
her
at
all
during
his
visit
and
addressed
himself
solely
to
pulcheria
alexandrovna
all
this
gave
him
extraordinary
inward
satisfaction
he
declared
that
he
thought
the
invalid
at
this
moment
going
on
very
satisfactorily
according
to
his
observation
the
patient
s
illness
wa
due
partly
to
his
unfortunate
material
surroundings
during
the
last
few
month
but
it
had
partly
also
a
moral
origin
wa
so
to
speak
the
product
of
several
material
and
moral
influence
anxiety
apprehension
trouble
certain
idea
and
so
noticing
stealthily
that
avdotya
romanovna
wa
following
his
word
with
close
attention
zossimov
allowed
himself
to
enlarge
on
this
theme
on
pulcheria
alexandrovna
s
anxiously
and
timidly
inquiring
a
to
some
suspicion
of
insanity
he
replied
with
a
composed
and
candid
smile
that
his
word
had
been
exaggerated
that
certainly
the
patient
had
some
fixed
idea
something
approaching
a
monomania
he
zossimov
wa
now
particularly
studying
this
interesting
branch
of
medicine
but
that
it
must
be
recollected
that
until
the
patient
had
been
in
delirium
and
and
that
no
doubt
the
presence
of
his
family
would
have
a
favourable
effect
on
his
recovery
and
distract
his
mind
if
only
all
fresh
shock
can
be
avoided
he
added
significantly
then
he
got
up
took
leave
with
an
impressive
and
affable
bow
while
blessing
warm
gratitude
and
entreaty
were
showered
upon
him
and
avdotya
romanovna
spontaneously
offered
her
hand
to
him
he
went
out
exceedingly
pleased
with
his
visit
and
still
more
so
with
himself
we
ll
talk
go
to
bed
at
once
razumihin
said
in
conclusion
following
zossimov
out
i
ll
be
with
you
morning
a
early
a
possible
with
my
that
s
a
fetching
little
girl
avdotya
romanovna
remarked
zossimov
almost
licking
his
lip
a
they
both
came
out
into
the
street
fetching
you
said
fetching
roared
razumihin
and
he
flew
at
zossimov
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
if
you
ever
dare
do
you
understand
do
you
understand
he
shouted
shaking
him
by
the
collar
and
squeezing
him
against
the
wall
do
you
hear
let
me
go
you
drunken
devil
said
zossimov
struggling
and
when
he
had
let
him
go
he
stared
at
him
and
went
off
into
a
sudden
guffaw
razumihin
stood
facing
him
in
gloomy
and
earnest
reflection
of
course
i
am
an
as
he
observed
sombre
a
a
storm
cloud
but
still
you
are
no
brother
not
at
all
such
another
i
am
not
dreaming
of
any
they
walked
along
in
silence
and
only
when
they
were
close
to
raskolnikov
s
lodging
razumihin
broke
the
silence
in
considerable
anxiety
listen
he
said
you
re
a
fellow
but
among
your
other
failing
you
re
a
loose
fish
that
i
know
and
a
dirty
one
too
you
are
a
feeble
nervous
wretch
and
a
mass
of
whim
you
re
getting
fat
and
lazy
and
can
t
deny
yourself
anything
and
i
call
that
dirty
because
it
lead
one
straight
into
the
dirt
you
ve
let
yourself
get
so
slack
that
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
you
are
still
a
good
even
a
devoted
doctor
you
a
doctor
sleep
on
a
feather
bed
and
get
up
at
night
to
your
patient
in
another
three
or
four
year
you
won
t
get
up
for
your
patient
but
hang
it
all
that
s
not
the
point
you
are
going
to
spend
in
the
landlady
s
flat
here
hard
work
i
ve
had
to
persuade
her
and
i
ll
be
in
the
kitchen
so
here
s
a
chance
for
you
to
get
to
know
her
better
it
s
not
a
you
think
there
s
not
a
trace
of
anything
of
the
sort
brother
but
i
don
t
think
here
you
have
modesty
brother
silence
bashfulness
a
savage
virtue
and
yet
she
s
sighing
and
melting
like
wax
simply
melting
save
me
from
her
by
all
that
s
unholy
she
s
most
prepossessing
i
ll
repay
you
i
ll
do
anything
zossimov
laughed
more
violently
than
ever
well
you
are
smitten
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
it
won
t
be
much
trouble
i
assure
you
talk
any
rot
you
like
to
her
a
long
a
you
sit
by
her
and
talk
you
re
a
doctor
too
try
curing
her
of
something
i
swear
you
won
t
regret
it

a
piano
and
you
know
i
strum
a
little
i
have
a
song
there

genuine
russian
one
i
shed
hot
she
like
the
genuine
article
and
well
it
all
began
with
that
song
now
you
re
a
regular
performer
a
a
rubinstein
i
assure
you
you
won
t
regret
it
but
have
you
made
her
some
promise
something
signed
a
promise
of
marriage
perhaps
nothing
nothing
absolutely
nothing
of
the
kind
besides
she
is
not
that
sort
at
all
tchebarov

that
well

can
t
that

all
about
it

attraction
here
then
why
have
you
fascinated
her
i
haven
t
fascinated
her
perhaps
i
wa
fascinated
myself
in
my
folly
but
she
won
t
care
a
straw
whether
it
s
you
or
i
so
long
a
somebody
sits
beside
her

time

and
you

bashful
to

clock
troubled
and
serious
he
found
himself
confronted
with
many
new
and
perplexity
he
had
never
expected
that
he
would
ever
wake
up
feeling
like
that
he
remembered
every
detail
of
the
previous
day
and
he
knew
that
a
perfectly
novel
experience
had
befallen
him
that
he
had
received
an
impression
unlike
anything
he
had
known
before
at
the
same
time
he
recognised
clearly
that
the
dream
which
had
fired
his
imagination
wa
hopelessly
unattainable
so
unattainable
that
he
felt
positively
ashamed
of
it
and
he
hastened
to
pas
to
the
other
more
practical
care
and
difficulty
bequeathed
him
by
that
thrice
accursed
the
most
awful
recollection
of
the
previous
day
wa
the
way
he
had
shown
himself
base
and
mean
not
only
because
he
had
been
drunk
but
because
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
young
girl
s
position
to
abuse
her
in
his
stupid
jealousy
knowing
nothing
of
their
mutual
relation
and
obligation
and
next
to
nothing
of
the
man
himself
and
what
right
had
he
to
criticise
him
in
that
hasty
and
unguarded
manner
who
had
asked
for
his
opinion
wa
it
thinkable
that
such
a
creature
a
avdotya
romanovna
would
be
marrying
an
unworthy
man
for
money
so
there
must
be
something
in
him
the
lodging
but
after
all
how
could
he
know
the
character
of
the
lodging
he
wa
furnishing
a
flat
foo
how
despicable
it
all
wa
and
what
justification
wa
it
that
he
wa
drunk
such
a
stupid
excuse
wa
even
more
degrading
in
wine
is
truth
and
the
truth
had
all
come
out
that
is
all
the
uncleanness
of
his
coarse
and
envious
heart
and
would
such
a
dream
ever
be
permissible
to
him
razumihin
what
wa
he
beside
such
a
girl
he
the
drunken
noisy
braggart
of
last
night
wa
it
possible
to
imagine
so
absurd
and
cynical
a
juxtaposition
razumihin
blushed
desperately
at
the
very
idea
and
suddenly
the
recollection
forced
itself
vividly
upon
him
of
how
he
had
said
last
night
on
the
stair
that
the
landlady
would
be
jealous
of
avdotya
romanovna
that
wa
simply
intolerable
he
brought
his
fist
down
heavily
on
the
kitchen
stove
hurt
his
hand
and
sent
one
of
the
brick
flying
of
course
he
muttered
to
himself
a
minute
later
with
a
feeling
of
of
course
all
these
infamy
can
never
be
wiped
out
or
smoothed
over
and
so
it
s
useless
even
to
think
of
it
and
i
must
go
to
them
in
silence
and
do
my
duty
in
silence
too
and
not
ask
forgiveness
and
say
nothing
for
all
is
lost
now
and
yet
a
he
dressed
he
examined
his
attire
more
carefully
than
usual
he
hadn
t
another
suit
if
he
had
had
perhaps
he
wouldn
t
have
put
it
on
i
would
have
made
a
point
of
not
putting
it
but
in
any
case
he
could
not
remain
a
cynic
and
a
dirty
sloven
he
had
no
right
to
offend
the
feeling
of
others
especially
when
they
were
in
need
of
his
assistance
and
asking
him
to
see
them
he
brushed
his
clothes
carefully
his
linen
wa
always
decent
in
that
respect
he
wa
especially
clean
he
washed
that
morning
scrupulously
he
got
some
soap
from
nastasya
he
washed
his
hair
his
neck
and
especially
his
hand
when
it
came
to
the
question
whether
to
shave
his
stubbly
chin
or
not
praskovya
pavlovna
had
capital
razor
that
had
been
left
by
her
late
husband
the
question
wa
angrily
answered
in
the
negative
let
it
stay
a
it
is
what
if
they
think
that
i
shaved
on
purpose
to
they
certainly
would
think
so
not
on
any
account
and
the
worst
of
it
wa
he
wa
so
coarse
so
dirty
he
had
the
manner
of
a
pothouse
and
and
even
admitting
that
he
knew
he
had
some
of
the
essential
of
a
gentleman
what
wa
there
in
that
to
be
proud
of
everyone
ought
to
be
a
gentleman
and
more
than
that
and
all
the
same
he
remembered
he
too
had
done
little
thing
not
exactly
dishonest
and
yet
and
what
thought
he
sometimes
had
hm
and
to
set
all
that
beside
avdotya
romanovna
confound
it
so
be
it
well
he
d
make
a
point
then
of
being
dirty
greasy
pothouse
in
his
manner
and
he
wouldn
t
care
he
d
be
worse
he
wa
engaged
in
such
monologue
when
zossimov
who
had
spent
the
night
in
praskovya
pavlovna
s
parlour
came
in
he
wa
going
home
and
wa
in
a
hurry
to
look
at
the
invalid
first
razumihin
informed
him
that
raskolnikov
wa
sleeping
like
a
dormouse
zossimov
gave
order
that
they
shouldn
t
wake
him
and
promised
to
see
him
again
about
eleven
if
he
is
still
at
home
he
added
damn
it
all
if
one
can
t
control
one
s
patient
how
is
one
to
cure
them
do
you
know
whether
will
go
to
them
or
whether
are
coming
here
they
are
coming
i
think
said
razumihin
understanding
the
object
of
the
question
and
they
will
discus
their
family
affair
no
doubt
i
ll
be
off
you
a
the
doctor
have
more
right
to
be
here
than
but
i
am
not
a
father
confessor
i
shall
come
and
go
away
i
ve
plenty
to
do
besides
looking
after
one
thing
worry
me
interposed
razumihin
frowning
on
the
way
home
i
talked
a
lot
of
drunken
nonsense
to
him
all
sort
of
thing
and
amongst
them
that
you
were
afraid
that
he
might
become
you
told
the
lady
so
i
know
it
wa
stupid
you
may
beat
me
if
you
like
did
you
think
so
seriously
that
s
nonsense
i
tell
you
how
could
i
think
it
seriously
you
yourself
described
him
a
a
monomaniac
when
you
fetched
me
to
him
and
we
added
fuel
to
the
fire
yesterday
you
did
that
is
with
your
story
about
the
painter
it
wa
a
nice
conversation
when
he
wa
perhaps
mad
on
that
very
point
if
only
i
d
known
what
happened
then
at
the
police
station
and
that
some
wretch
had
insulted
him
with
this
suspicion
hm
i
would
not
have
allowed
that
conversation
yesterday
these
monomaniac
will
make
a
mountain
out
of
a
and
see
their
fancy
a
solid
reality
a
far
a
i
remember
it
wa
zametov
s
story
that
cleared
up
half
the
mystery
to
my
mind
why
i
know
one
case
in
which
a
hypochondriac
a
man
of
forty
cut
the
throat
of
a
little
boy
of
eight
because
he
couldn
t
endure
the
joke
he
made
every
day
at
table
and
in
this
case
his
rag
the
insolent
police
officer
the
fever
and
this
suspicion
all
that
working
upon
a
man
half
frantic
with
hypochondria
and
with
his
morbid
exceptional
vanity
that
may
well
have
been
the
of
illness
well
bother
it
all
and
by
the
way
that
zametov
certainly
is
a
nice
fellow
but
hm
he
shouldn
t
have
told
all
that
last
night
he
is
an
awful
chatterbox
but
whom
did
he
tell
it
to
you
and
me
and
what
doe
that
matter
and
by
the
way
have
you
any
influence
on
them
his
mother
and
sister
tell
them
to
be
more
careful
with
him
they
ll
get
on
all
right
razumihin
answered
reluctantly
why
is
he
so
set
against
this
luzhin
a
man
with
money
and
she
doesn
t
seem
to
dislike
him
and
they
haven
t
a
farthing
i
suppose
eh
but
what
business
is
it
of
yours
razumihin
cried
with
annoyance
how
can
i
tell
whether
they
ve
a
farthing
ask
them
yourself
and
perhaps
you
ll
find
out
foo
what
an
as
you
are
sometimes
last
night
s
wine
ha
not
gone
off
yet
thank
your
praskovya
pavlovna
from
me
for
my
night
s
lodging
she
locked
herself
in
made
no
reply
to
my
through
the
door
she
wa
up
at
seven
o
clock
the
samovar
wa
taken
into
her
from
the
kitchen
i
wa
not
vouchsafed
a
personal
interview
at
nine
o
clock
precisely
razumihin
reached
the
lodging
at
bakaleyev
s
house
both
lady
were
waiting
for
him
with
nervous
impatience
they
had
risen
at
seven
o
clock
or
earlier
he
entered
looking
a
black
a
night
bowed
awkwardly
and
wa
at
once
furious
with
himself
for
it
he
had
reckoned
without
his
host
pulcheria
alexandrovna
fairly
rushed
at
him
seized
him
by
both
hand
and
wa
almost
kissing
them
he
glanced
timidly
at
avdotya
romanovna
but
her
proud
countenance
wore
at
that
moment
an
expression
of
such
gratitude
and
friendliness
such
complete
and
respect
in
place
of
the
sneering
look
and
contempt
he
had
expected
that
it
threw
him
into
greater
confusion
than
if
he
had
been
met
with
abuse
fortunately
there
wa
a
subject
for
conversation
and
he
made
haste
to
snatch
at
it
hearing
that
everything
wa
going
well
and
that
rodya
had
not
yet
waked
pulcheria
alexandrovna
declared
that
she
wa
glad
to
hear
it
because
she
had
something
which
it
wa
very
very
necessary
to
talk
over
then
followed
an
inquiry
about
breakfast
and
an
invitation
to
have
it
with
them
they
had
waited
to
have
it
with
him
avdotya
romanovna
rang
the
bell
it
wa
answered
by
a
ragged
dirty
waiter
and
they
asked
him
to
bring
tea
which
wa
served
at
last
but
in
such
a
dirty
and
disorderly
way
that
the
lady
were
ashamed
razumihin
vigorously
attacked
the
lodging
but
remembering
luzhin
stopped
in
embarrassment
and
wa
greatly
relieved
by
pulcheria
alexandrovna
s
question
which
showered
in
a
continual
stream
upon
him
he
talked
for
three
quarter
of
an
hour
being
constantly
interrupted
by
their
question
and
succeeded
in
describing
to
them
all
the
most
important
fact
he
knew
of
the
last
year
of
raskolnikov
s
life
concluding
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
his
illness
he
omitted
however
many
thing
which
were
better
omitted
including
the
scene
at
the
police
station
with
all
it
consequence
they
listened
eagerly
to
his
story
and
when
he
thought
he
had
finished
and
satisfied
his
listener
he
found
that
they
considered
he
had
hardly
begun
tell
me
tell
me
what
do
you
think
excuse
me
i
still
don
t
know
your
name
pulcheria
alexandrovna
put
in
hastily
dmitri
i
should
like
very
very
much
to
know
dmitri
prokofitch
how
he
look
on
thing
in
general
now
that
is
how
can
i
explain
what
are
his
like
and
dislike
is
he
always
so
irritable
tell
me
if
you
can
what
are
his
hope
and
so
to
say
his
dream
under
what
influence
is
he
now
in
a
word
i
should
like
ah
mother
how
can
he
answer
all
that
at
once
observed
dounia
good
heaven
i
had
not
expected
to
find
him
in
the
least
like
this
dmitri
prokofitch
naturally
answered
razumihin
i
have
no
mother
but
my
uncle
come
every
year
and
almost
every
time
he
can
scarcely
recognise
me
even
in
appearance
though
he
is
a
clever
man
and
your
three
year
separation
mean
a
great
deal
what
am
i
to
tell
you
i
have
known
rodion
for
a
year
and
a
half
he
is
morose
gloomy
proud
and
haughty
and
of
late
and
perhaps
for
a
long
time
before
he
ha
been
suspicious
and
fanciful
he
ha
a
noble
nature
and
a
kind
heart
he
doe
not
like
showing
his
feeling
and
would
rather
do
a
cruel
thing
than
open
his
heart
freely
sometimes
though
he
is
not
at
all
morbid
but
simply
cold
and
inhumanly
callous
it
s
a
though
he
were
alternating
between
two
character
sometimes
he
is
fearfully
reserved
he
say
he
is
so
busy
that
everything
is
a
hindrance
and
yet
he
lie
in
bed
doing
nothing
he
doesn
t
jeer
at
thing
not
because
he
hasn
t
the
wit
but
a
though
he
hadn
t
time
to
waste
on
such
trifle
he
never
listens
to
what
is
said
to
him
he
is
never
interested
in
what
interest
other
people
at
any
given
moment
he
think
very
highly
of
himself
and
perhaps
he
is
right
well
what
more
i
think
your
arrival
will
have
a
most
beneficial
influence
upon
god
grant
it
may
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
distressed
by
razumihin
s
account
of
her
rodya
and
razumihin
ventured
to
look
more
boldly
at
avdotya
romanovna
at
last
he
glanced
at
her
often
while
he
wa
talking
but
only
for
a
moment
and
looked
away
again
at
once
avdotya
romanovna
sat
at
the
table
listening
attentively
then
got
up
again
and
began
walking
to
and
fro
with
her
arm
folded
and
her
lip
compressed
occasionally
putting
in
a
question
without
stopping
her
walk
she
had
the
same
habit
of
not
listening
to
what
wa
said
she
wa
wearing
a
dress
of
thin
dark
stuff
and
she
had
a
white
transparent
scarf
round
her
neck
razumihin
soon
detected
sign
of
extreme
poverty
in
their
belonging
had
avdotya
romanovna
been
dressed
like
a
queen
he
felt
that
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
her
but
perhaps
just
because
she
wa
poorly
dressed
and
that
he
noticed
all
the
misery
of
her
surroundings
his
heart
wa
filled
with
dread
and
he
began
to
be
afraid
of
every
word
he
uttered
every
gesture
he
made
which
wa
very
trying
for
a
man
who
already
felt
diffident
you
ve
told
u
a
great
deal
that
is
interesting
about
my
brother
s
character
and
have
told
it
impartially
i
am
glad
i
thought
that
you
were
too
uncritically
devoted
to
him
observed
avdotya
romanovna
with
a
smile
i
think
you
are
right
that
he
need
a
woman
s
care
she
added
thoughtfully
i
didn
t
say
so
but
i
daresay
you
are
right
only
what
he
love
no
one
and
perhaps
he
never
will
razumihin
declared
decisively
you
mean
he
is
not
capable
of
love
do
you
know
avdotya
romanovna
you
are
awfully
like
your
brother
in
everything
indeed
he
blurted
out
suddenly
to
his
own
surprise
but
remembering
at
once
what
he
had
just
before
said
of
her
brother
he
turned
a
red
a
a
crab
and
wa
overcome
with
confusion
avdotya
romanovna
couldn
t
help
laughing
when
she
looked
at
him
you
may
both
be
mistaken
about
rodya
pulcheria
alexandrovna
remarked
slightly
piqued
i
am
not
talking
of
our
present
difficulty
dounia
what
pyotr
petrovitch
writes
in
this
letter
and
what
you
and
i
have
supposed
may
be
mistaken
but
you
can
t
imagine
dmitri
prokofitch
how
moody
and
so
to
say
capricious
he
is
i
never
could
depend
on
what
he
would
do
when
he
wa
only
fifteen
and
i
am
sure
that
he
might
do
something
now
that
nobody
else
would
think
of
doing
well
for
instance
do
you
know
how
a
year
and
a
half
ago
he
astounded
me
and
gave
me
a
shock
that
nearly
killed
me
when
he
had
the
idea
of
marrying
that
girl
what
wa
her
name
his
landlady
s
daughter
did
you
hear
about
that
affair
asked
avdotya
romanovna
do
you
suppose
pulcheria
alexandrovna
continued
warmly
do
you
suppose
that
my
tear
my
entreaty
my
illness
my
possible
death
from
grief
our
poverty
would
have
made
him
pause
no
he
would
calmly
have
disregarded
all
obstacle
and
yet
it
isn
t
that
he
doesn
t
love
u
he
ha
never
spoken
a
word
of
that
affair
to
me
razumihin
answered
cautiously
but
i
did
hear
something
from
praskovya
pavlovna
herself
though
she
is
by
no
mean
a
gossip
and
what
i
heard
certainly
wa
rather
and
what
did
you
hear
both
the
lady
asked
at
once
well
nothing
very
special
i
only
learned
that
the
marriage
which
only
failed
to
take
place
through
the
girl
s
death
wa
not
at
all
to
praskovya
pavlovna
s
liking
they
say
too
the
girl
wa
not
at
all
pretty
in
fact
i
am
told
positively
ugly
and
such
an
invalid
and
queer
but
she
seems
to
have
had
some
good
quality
she
must
have
had
some
good
quality
or
it
s
quite
inexplicable
she
had
no
money
either
and
he
wouldn
t
have
considered
her
money
but
it
s
always
difficult
to
judge
in
such
i
am
sure
she
wa
a
good
girl
avdotya
romanovna
observed
briefly
god
forgive
me
i
simply
rejoiced
at
her
death
though
i
don
t
know
which
of
them
would
have
caused
most
misery
to
the
other
he
to
her
or
she
to
him
pulcheria
alexandrovna
concluded
then
she
began
tentatively
questioning
him
about
the
scene
on
the
previous
day
with
luzhin
hesitating
and
continually
glancing
at
dounia
obviously
to
the
latter
s
annoyance
this
incident
more
than
all
the
rest
evidently
caused
her
uneasiness
even
consternation
razumihin
described
it
in
detail
again
but
this
time
he
added
his
own
conclusion
he
openly
blamed
raskolnikov
for
intentionally
insulting
pyotr
petrovitch
not
seeking
to
excuse
him
on
the
score
of
his
illness
he
had
planned
it
before
his
illness
he
added
i
think
so
too
pulcheria
alexandrovna
agreed
with
a
dejected
air
but
she
wa
very
much
surprised
at
hearing
razumihin
express
himself
so
carefully
and
even
with
a
certain
respect
about
pyotr
petrovitch
avdotya
romanovna
too
wa
struck
by
it
so
this
is
your
opinion
of
pyotr
petrovitch
pulcheria
alexandrovna
could
not
resist
asking
i
can
have
no
other
opinion
of
your
daughter
s
future
husband
razumihin
answered
firmly
and
with
warmth
and
i
don
t
say
it
simply
from
vulgar
politeness
but
because
simply
because
avdotya
romanovna
ha
of
her
own
free
will
deigned
to
accept
this
man
if
i
spoke
so
rudely
of
him
last
night
it
wa
because
i
wa
disgustingly
drunk
and
mad
besides
yes
mad
crazy
i
lost
my
head
completely
and
this
morning
i
am
ashamed
of
he
crimsoned
and
ceased
speaking
avdotya
romanovna
flushed
but
did
not
break
the
silence
she
had
not
uttered
a
word
from
the
moment
they
began
to
speak
of
luzhin
without
her
support
pulcheria
alexandrovna
obviously
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
last
faltering
and
continually
glancing
at
her
daughter
she
confessed
that
she
wa
exceedingly
worried
by
one
circumstance
you
see
dmitri
prokofitch
she
began
i
ll
be
perfectly
open
with
dmitri
prokofitch
dounia
of
course
mother
said
avdotya
romanovna
emphatically
this
is
what
it
is
she
began
in
haste
a
though
the
permission
to
speak
of
her
trouble
lifted
a
weight
off
her
mind
very
early
this
morning
we
got
a
note
from
pyotr
petrovitch
in
reply
to
our
letter
announcing
our
arrival
he
promised
to
meet
u
at
the
station
you
know
instead
of
that
he
sent
a
servant
to
bring
u
the
address
of
these
lodging
and
to
show
u
the
way
and
he
sent
a
message
that
he
would
be
here
himself
this
morning
but
this
morning
this
note
came
from
him
you
d
better
read
it
yourself
there
is
one
point
in
it
which
worry
me
very
much
you
will
soon
see
what
that
is
and
tell
me
your
candid
opinion
dmitri
prokofitch
you
know
rodya
s
character
better
than
anyone
and
no
one
can
advise
u
better
than
you
can
dounia
i
must
tell
you
made
her
decision
at
once
but
i
still
don
t
feel
sure
how
to
act
and
i
i
ve
been
waiting
for
your
razumihin
opened
the
note
which
wa
dated
the
previous
evening
and
read
a
follows
dear
madam
pulcheria
alexandrovna
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
owing
to
unforeseen
obstacle
i
wa
rendered
unable
to
meet
you
at
the
railway
station
i
sent
a
very
competent
person
with
the
same
object
in
view
i
likewise
shall
be
deprived
of
the
honour
of
an
interview
with
you
morning
by
business
in
the
senate
that
doe
not
admit
of
delay
and
also
that
i
may
not
intrude
on
your
family
circle
while
you
are
meeting
your
son
and
avdotya
romanovna
her
brother
i
shall
have
the
honour
of
visiting
you
and
paying
you
my
respect
at
your
lodging
not
later
than
evening
at
eight
o
clock
precisely
and
herewith
i
venture
to
present
my
earnest
and
i
may
add
imperative
request
that
rodion
romanovitch
may
not
be
present
at
our
interview
a
he
offered
me
a
gross
and
unprecedented
affront
on
the
occasion
of
my
visit
to
him
in
his
illness
yesterday
and
moreover
since
i
desire
from
you
personally
an
indispensable
and
circumstantial
explanation
upon
a
certain
point
in
regard
to
which
i
wish
to
learn
your
own
interpretation
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
in
anticipation
that
if
in
spite
of
my
request
i
meet
rodion
romanovitch
i
shall
be
compelled
to
withdraw
immediately
and
then
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
i
write
on
the
assumption
that
rodion
romanovitch
who
appeared
so
ill
at
my
visit
suddenly
recovered
two
hour
later
and
so
being
able
to
leave
the
house
may
visit
you
also
i
wa
confirmed
in
that
belief
by
the
testimony
of
my
own
eye
in
the
lodging
of
a
drunken
man
who
wa
run
over
and
ha
since
died
to
whose
daughter
a
young
woman
of
notorious
behaviour
he
gave
rouble
on
the
pretext
of
the
funeral
which
gravely
surprised
me
knowing
what
pain
you
were
at
to
raise
that
sum
herewith
expressing
my
special
respect
to
your
estimable
daughter
avdotya
romanovna
i
beg
you
to
accept
the
respectful
homage
of
your
humble
servant
p
what
am
i
to
do
now
dmitri
prokofitch
began
pulcheria
alexandrovna
almost
weeping
how
can
i
ask
rodya
not
to
come
yesterday
he
insisted
so
earnestly
on
our
refusing
pyotr
petrovitch
and
now
we
are
ordered
not
to
receive
rodya
he
will
come
on
purpose
if
he
know
and
what
will
happen
then
act
on
avdotya
romanovna
s
decision
razumihin
answered
calmly
at
once
oh
dear
me
she
say
goodness
know
what
she
say
she
doesn
t
explain
her
object
she
say
that
it
would
be
best
at
least
not
that
it
would
be
best
but
that
it
s
absolutely
necessary
that
rodya
should
make
a
point
of
being
here
at
eight
o
clock
and
that
they
must
meet
i
didn
t
want
even
to
show
him
the
letter
but
to
prevent
him
from
coming
by
some
stratagem
with
your
help
because
he
is
so
irritable
besides
i
don
t
understand
about
that
drunkard
who
died
and
that
daughter
and
how
he
could
have
given
the
daughter
all
the
money
which
which
cost
you
such
sacrifice
mother
put
in
avdotya
romanovna
he
wa
not
himself
yesterday
razumihin
said
thoughtfully
if
you
only
knew
what
he
wa
up
to
in
a
restaurant
yesterday
though
there
wa
sense
in
it
too
hm
he
did
say
something
a
we
were
going
home
yesterday
evening
about
a
dead
man
and
a
girl
but
i
didn
t
understand
a
word
but
last
night
i
myself
the
best
thing
mother
will
be
for
u
to
go
to
him
ourselves
and
there
i
assure
you
we
shall
see
at
once
what
s
to
be
done
besides
it
s
getting
late
good
heaven
it
s
past
ten
she
cried
looking
at
a
splendid
gold
enamelled
watch
which
hung
round
her
neck
on
a
thin
venetian
chain
and
looked
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
rest
of
her
dress
a
present
from
her
thought
razumihin
we
must
start
dounia
we
must
start
her
mother
cried
in
a
flutter
he
will
be
thinking
we
are
still
angry
after
yesterday
from
our
coming
so
late
merciful
heaven
while
she
said
this
she
wa
hurriedly
putting
on
her
hat
and
mantle
dounia
too
put
on
her
thing
her
glove
a
razumihin
noticed
were
not
merely
shabby
but
had
hole
in
them
and
yet
this
evident
poverty
gave
the
two
lady
an
air
of
special
dignity
which
is
always
found
in
people
who
know
how
to
wear
poor
clothes
razumihin
looked
reverently
at
dounia
and
felt
proud
of
escorting
her
the
queen
who
mended
her
stocking
in
prison
he
thought
must
have
looked
then
every
inch
a
queen
and
even
more
a
queen
than
at
sumptuous
banquet
and
my
god
exclaimed
pulcheria

think
that

ever
fear
seeing
my
son
my
darling

dmitri

she
added
glancing
at
him
timidly

mother
said
dounia
kissing
her
better

faith
in
oh
dear

faith
in
him
but
i
haven

exclaimed
the
poor
woman
they
came
out
into
the
street
do
you
know
dounia
when
i
dozed
a
little
this
morning
i
dreamed
of
marfa
petrovna
she
wa
all
in
white
she
came
up
to
me
took
my
hand
and
shook
her
head
at
me
but
so
sternly
a
though
she
were
blaming
me
is
that
a
good
omen
oh
dear
me
you
don
t
know
dmitri
prokofitch
that
marfa
petrovna
s
dead
no
i
didn
t
know
who
is
marfa
petrovna
she
died
suddenly
and
only
fancy
afterwards
mamma
put
in
dounia
he
doesn
t
know
who
marfa
petrovna
ah
you
don
t
know
and
i
wa
thinking
that
you
knew
all
about
u
forgive
me
dmitri
prokofitch
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
thinking
about
these
last
few
day
i
look
upon
you
really
a
a
providence
for
u
and
so
i
took
it
for
granted
that
you
knew
all
about
u
i
look
on
you
a
a
relation
don
t
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
so
dear
me
what
s
the
matter
with
your
right
hand
have
you
knocked
it
yes
i
bruised
it
muttered
razumihin
overjoyed
i
sometimes
speak
too
much
from
the
heart
so
that
dounia
find
fault
with
me
but
dear
me
what
a
cupboard
he
life
in
i
wonder
whether
he
is
awake
doe
this
woman
his
landlady
consider
it
a
room
listen
you
say
he
doe
not
like
to
show
his
feeling
so
perhaps
i
shall
annoy
him
with
my
weakness
do
advise
me
dmitri
prokofitch
how
am
i
to
treat
him
i
feel
quite
distracted
you
don
t
question
him
too
much
about
anything
if
you
see
him
frown
don
t
ask
him
too
much
about
his
health
he
doesn
t
like
ah
dmitri
prokofitch
how
hard
it
is
to
be
a
mother
but
here
are
the
stair
what
an
awful
staircase
mother
you
are
quite
pale
don
t
distress
yourself
darling
said
dounia
caressing
her
then
with
flashing
eye
she
added
he
ought
to
be
happy
at
seeing
you
and
you
are
tormenting
yourself
wait
i
ll
peep
in
and
see
whether
he
ha
waked
the
lady
slowly
followed
razumihin
who
went
on
before
and
when
they
reached
the
landlady
s
door
on
the
fourth
storey
they
noticed
that
her
door
wa
a
tiny
crack
open
and
that
two
keen
black
eye
were
watching
them
from
the
darkness
within
when
their
eye
met
the
door
wa
suddenly
shut
with
such
a
slam
that
pulcheria
alexandrovna
almost
cried
out
chapter
iii
he
is
well
quite
well
zossimov
cried
cheerfully
a
they
entered
he
had
come
in
ten
minute
earlier
and
wa
sitting
in
the
same
place
a
before
on
the
sofa
raskolnikov
wa
sitting
in
the
opposite
corner
fully
dressed
and
carefully
washed
and
combed
a
he
had
not
been
for
some
time
past
the
room
wa
immediately
crowded
yet
nastasya
managed
to
follow
the
visitor
in
and
stayed
to
listen
raskolnikov
really
wa
almost
well
a
compared
with
his
condition
the
day
before
but
he
wa
still
pale
listless
and
sombre
he
looked
like
a
wounded
man
or
one
who
ha
undergone
some
terrible
physical
suffering
his
brow
were
knitted
his
lip
compressed
his
eye
feverish
he
spoke
little
and
reluctantly
a
though
performing
a
duty
and
there
wa
a
restlessness
in
his
movement
he
only
wanted
a
sling
on
his
arm
or
a
bandage
on
his
finger
to
complete
the
impression
of
a
man
with
a
painful
abscess
or
a
broken
arm
the
pale
sombre
face
lighted
up
for
a
moment
when
his
mother
and
sister
entered
but
this
only
gave
it
a
look
of
more
intense
suffering
in
place
of
it
listless
dejection
the
light
soon
died
away
but
the
look
of
suffering
remained
and
zossimov
watching
and
studying
his
patient
with
all
the
zest
of
a
young
doctor
beginning
to
practise
noticed
in
him
no
joy
at
the
arrival
of
his
mother
and
sister
but
a
sort
of
bitter
hidden
determination
to
bear
another
hour
or
two
of
inevitable
torture
he
saw
later
that
almost
every
word
of
the
following
conversation
seemed
to
touch
on
some
sore
place
and
irritate
it
but
at
the
same
time
he
marvelled
at
the
power
of
controlling
himself
and
hiding
his
feeling
in
a
patient
who
the
previous
day
had
like
a
monomaniac
fallen
into
a
frenzy
at
the
slightest
word
yes
i
see
myself
now
that
i
am
almost
well
said
raskolnikov
giving
his
mother
and
sister
a
kiss
of
welcome
which
made
pulcheria
alexandrovna
radiant
at
once
and
i
don
t
say
this
i
did
he
said
addressing
razumihin
with
a
friendly
pressure
of
his
hand
yes
indeed
i
am
quite
surprised
at
him
began
zossimov
much
delighted
at
the
lady
entrance
for
he
had
not
succeeded
in
keeping
up
a
conversation
with
his
patient
for
ten
minute
in
another
three
or
four
day
if
he
go
on
like
this
he
will
be
just
a
before
that
is
a
he
wa
a
month
ago
or
two
or
perhaps
even
three
this
ha
been
coming
on
for
a
long
while
eh
confess
now
that
it
ha
been
perhaps
your
own
fault
he
added
with
a
tentative
smile
a
though
still
afraid
of
irritating
him
it
is
very
possible
answered
raskolnikov
coldly
i
should
say
too
continued
zossimov
with
zest
that
your
complete
recovery
depends
solely
on
yourself
now
that
one
can
talk
to
you
i
should
like
to
impress
upon
you
that
it
is
essential
to
avoid
the
elementary
so
to
speak
fundamental
cause
tending
to
produce
your
morbid
condition
in
that
case
you
will
be
cured
if
not
it
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
these
fundamental
cause
i
don
t
know
but
they
must
be
known
to
you
you
are
an
intelligent
man
and
must
have
observed
yourself
of
course
i
fancy
the
first
stage
of
your
derangement
coincides
with
your
leaving
the
university
you
must
not
be
left
without
occupation
and
so
work
and
a
definite
aim
set
before
you
might
i
fancy
be
very
yes
yes
you
are
perfectly
right
i
will
make
haste
and
return
to
the
university
and
then
everything
will
go
smoothly
zossimov
who
had
begun
his
sage
advice
partly
to
make
an
effect
before
the
lady
wa
certainly
somewhat
mystified
when
glancing
at
his
patient
he
observed
unmistakable
mockery
on
his
face
this
lasted
an
instant
however
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
at
once
thanking
zossimov
especially
for
his
visit
to
their
lodging
the
previous
night
what
he
saw
you
last
night
raskolnikov
asked
a
though
startled
then
you
have
not
slept
either
after
your
ach
rodya
that
wa
only
till
two
o
clock
dounia
and
i
never
go
to
bed
before
two
at
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
him
either
raskolnikov
went
on
suddenly
frowning
and
looking
down
setting
aside
the
question
of
payment
forgive
me
for
referring
to
it
he
turned
to
zossimov
i
really
don
t
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
such
special
attention
from
you
i
simply
don
t
understand
it
and
and
it
weighs
upon
me
indeed
because
i
don
t
understand
it
i
tell
you
so
don
t
be
zossimov
forced
himself
to
laugh
assume
that
you
are
my
first
patient
well
we
fellow
just
beginning
to
practise
love
our
first
patient
a
if
they
were
our
child
and
some
almost
fall
in
love
with
them
and
of
course
i
am
not
rich
in
i
say
nothing
about
him
added
raskolnikov
pointing
to
razumihin
though
he
ha
had
nothing
from
me
either
but
insult
and
what
nonsense
he
is
talking
why
you
are
in
a
sentimental
mood
are
you
shouted
razumihin
if
he
had
had
more
penetration
he
would
have
seen
that
there
wa
no
trace
of
sentimentality
in
him
but
something
indeed
quite
the
opposite
but
avdotya
romanovna
noticed
it
she
wa
intently
and
uneasily
watching
her
brother
a
for
you
mother
i
don
t
dare
to
speak
he
went
on
a
though
repeating
a
lesson
learned
by
heart
it
is
only
that
i
have
been
able
to
realise
a
little
how
distressed
you
must
have
been
here
yesterday
waiting
for
me
to
come
when
he
had
said
this
he
suddenly
held
out
his
hand
to
his
sister
smiling
without
a
word
but
in
this
smile
there
wa
a
flash
of
real
unfeigned
feeling
dounia
caught
it
at
once
and
warmly
pressed
his
hand
overjoyed
and
thankful
it
wa
the
first
time
he
had
addressed
her
since
their
dispute
the
previous
day
the
mother
s
face
lighted
up
with
ecstatic
happiness
at
the
sight
of
this
conclusive
unspoken
reconciliation
yes
that
is
what
i
love
him
for
razumihin
exaggerating
it
all
muttered
to
himself
with
a
vigorous
turn
in
his
chair
he
ha
these
and
how
well
he
doe
it
all
the
mother
wa
thinking
to
herself
what
generous
impulse
he
ha
and
how
simply
how
delicately
he
put
an
end
to
all
the
misunderstanding
with
his
sister
simply
by
holding
out
his
hand
at
the
right
minute
and
looking
at
her
like
that
and
what
fine
eye
he
ha
and
how
fine
his
whole
face
is
he
is
even
better
looking
than
dounia
but
good
heaven
what
a
suit
how
terribly
he
s
dressed
vasya
the
messenger
boy
in
afanasy
ivanitch
s
shop
is
better
dressed
i
could
rush
at
him
and
hug
him
weep
over
him
but
i
am
afraid
oh
dear
he
s
so
strange
he
s
talking
kindly
but
i
m
afraid
why
what
am
i
afraid
of
oh
rodya
you
wouldn
t
believe
she
began
suddenly
in
haste
to
answer
his
word
to
her
how
unhappy
dounia
and
i
were
yesterday
now
that
it
s
all
over
and
done
with
and
we
are
quite
happy
again
i
can
tell
you
fancy
we
ran
here
almost
straight
from
the
train
to
embrace
you
and
that
woman
ah
here
she
is
good
morning
nastasya
she
told
u
at
once
that
you
were
lying
in
a
high
fever
and
had
just
run
away
from
the
doctor
in
delirium
and
they
were
looking
for
you
in
the
street
you
can
t
imagine
how
we
felt
i
couldn
t
help
thinking
of
the
tragic
end
of
lieutenant
potanchikov
a
friend
of
your
father
s
you
can
t
remember
him
rodya
who
ran
out
in
the
same
way
in
a
high
fever
and
fell
into
the
well
in
the
and
they
couldn
t
pull
him
out
till
next
day
of
course
we
exaggerated
thing
we
were
on
the
point
of
rushing
to
find
pyotr
petrovitch
to
ask
him
to
help
because
we
were
alone
utterly
alone
she
said
plaintively
and
stopped
short
suddenly
recollecting
it
wa
still
somewhat
dangerous
to
speak
of
pyotr
petrovitch
although
we
are
quite
happy
yes
yes
of
course
it
s
very
annoying
raskolnikov
muttered
in
reply
but
with
such
a
preoccupied
and
inattentive
air
that
dounia
gazed
at
him
in
perplexity
what
else
wa
it
i
wanted
to
say
he
went
on
trying
to
recollect
oh
yes
mother
and
you
too
dounia
please
don
t
think
that
i
didn
t
mean
to
come
and
see
you
and
wa
waiting
for
you
to
come
what
are
you
saying
rodya
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
she
too
wa
surprised
is
he
answering
u
a
a
duty
dounia
wondered
is
he
being
reconciled
and
asking
forgiveness
a
though
he
were
performing
a
rite
or
repeating
a
lesson
i
ve
only
just
waked
up
and
wanted
to
go
to
you
but
wa
delayed
owing
to
my
clothes
i
forgot
yesterday
to
ask
her
nastasya
to
wash
out
the
blood
i
ve
only
just
blood
what

asked
in
alarm
oh
nothing
don
t
be
uneasy
it
wa
when
i
wa
wandering
about
yesterday
rather
delirious
i
chanced
upon
a
man
who
had
been
run
over
a
clerk
delirious
but
you
remember
everything
razumihin
interrupted
that
s
true
raskolnikov
answered
with
special
carefulness
i
remember
everything
even
to
the
slightest
detail
and
yet
why
i
did
that
and
went
there
and
said
that
i
can
t
clearly
explain
a
familiar
phenomenon

zossimov
action
are
sometimes
performed
in
a
masterly
and
most
cunning
way
while
the
direction
of
the
action
is
deranged
and
dependent
on
various
morbid
impression
it
s
like
a
perhaps
it
s
a
good
thing
really
that
he
should
think
me
almost
a
madman
thought
raskolnikov
why
people
in
perfect
health
act
in
the
same
way
too
observed
dounia
looking
uneasily
at
zossimov
there
is
some
truth
in
your
observation
the
latter
replied
in
that
sense
we
are
certainly
all
not
infrequently
like
madman
but
with
the
slight
difference
that
the
deranged
are
somewhat
madder
for
we
must
draw
a
line
a
normal
man

is
true
hardly
exists
among
dozen
perhaps
hundred
of
thousand
hardly
one
is
to
be
met
at
the
word
madman
carelessly
dropped
by
zossimov
in
his
chatter
on
his
favourite
subject
everyone
frowned
raskolnikov
sat
seeming
not
to
pay
attention
plunged
in
thought
with
a
strange
smile
on
his
pale
lip
he
wa
still
meditating
on
something
well
what
about
the
man
who
wa
run
over
i
interrupted
you
razumihin
cried
hastily
what
raskolnikov
seemed
to
wake
up
oh
i
got
spattered
with
blood
helping
to
carry
him
to
his
lodging
by
the
way
mamma
i
did
an
unpardonable
thing
yesterday
i
wa
literally
out
of
my
mind
i
gave
away
all
the
money
you
sent
me
to
his
wife
for
the
funeral
she
s
a
widow
now
in
consumption
a
poor
creature
three
little
child
starving
nothing
in
the
house
there
s
a
daughter
too
perhaps
you
d
have
given
it
yourself
if
you
d
seen
them
but
i
had
no
right
to
do
it
i
admit
especially
a
i
knew
how
you
needed
the
money
yourself
to
help
others
one
must
have
the
right
to
do
it
or
else
chiens
si
vous
n

he
laughed
that
s
right
isn
t
it
dounia
no
it
s
not
answered
dounia
firmly
bah
you
too
have
ideal
he
muttered
looking
at
her
almost
with
hatred
and
smiling
sarcastically
i
ought
to
have
considered
that
well
that
s
praiseworthy
and
it
s
better
for
you
and
if
you
reach
a
line
you
won
t
overstep
you
will
be
unhappy
and
if
you
overstep
it
maybe
you
will
be
still
unhappier
but
all
that
s
nonsense
he
added
irritably
vexed
at
being
carried
away
i
only
meant
to
say
that
i
beg
your
forgiveness
mother
he
concluded
shortly
and
abruptly
that
s
enough
rodya
i
am
sure
that
everything
you
do
is
very
good
said
his
mother
delighted
don
t
be
too
sure
he
answered
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
smile
a
silence
followed
there
wa
a
certain
constraint
in
all
this
conversation
and
in
the
silence
and
in
the
reconciliation
and
in
the
forgiveness
and
all
were
feeling
it
it
is
a
though
they
were
afraid
of
me
raskolnikov
wa
thinking
to
himself
looking
askance
at
his
mother
and
sister
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
indeed
growing
more
timid
the
longer
she
kept
silent
yet
in
their
absence
i
seemed
to
love
them
so
much
flashed
through
his
mind
do
you
know
rodya
marfa
petrovna
is
dead
pulcheria
alexandrovna
suddenly
blurted
out
what
marfa
petrovna
oh
mercy
on
u
marfa
petrovna
svidrigaïlov
i
wrote
you
so
much
about
yes
i
remember
so
she
s
dead
oh
really
he
roused
himself
suddenly
a
if
waking
up
what
did
she
die
of
only
imagine
quite
suddenly
pulcheria
alexandrovna
answered
hurriedly
encouraged
by
his
curiosity
on
the
very
day
i
wa
sending
you
that
letter
would
you
believe
it
that
awful
man
seems
to
have
been
the
cause
of
her
death
they
say
he
beat
her
why
were
they
on
such
bad
term
he
asked
addressing
his
sister
not
at
all
quite
the
contrary
indeed
with
her
he
wa
always
very
patient
considerate
even
in
fact
all
those
seven
year
of
their
married
life
he
gave
way
to
her
too
much
so
indeed
in
many
case
all
of
a
sudden
he
seems
to
have
lost
then
he
could
not
have
been
so
awful
if
he
controlled
himself
for
seven
year
you
seem
to
be
defending
him
dounia
no
no
he
s
an
awful
man
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
awful
dounia
answered
almost
with
a
shudder
knitting
her
brow
and
sinking
into
thought
that
had
happened
in
the
morning
pulcheria
alexandrovna
went
on
hurriedly
and
directly
afterwards
she
ordered
the
horse
to
be
harnessed
to
drive
to
the
town
immediately
after
dinner
she
always
used
to
drive
to
the
town
in
such
case
she
ate
a
very
good
dinner
i
am
told
after
the
beating
that
wa
always
her
habit
and
immediately
after
dinner
so
a
not
to
be
late
in
starting
she
went
to
the
you
see
she
wa
undergoing
some
treatment
with
bath
they
have
a
cold
spring
there
and
she
used
to
bathe
in
it
regularly
every
day
and
no
sooner
had
she
got
into
the
water
when
she
suddenly
had
a
stroke
i
should
think
so
said
zossimov
and
did
he
beat
her
badly
what
doe
that
matter
put
in
dounia
h
m
but
i
don
t
know
why
you
want
to
tell
u
such
gossip
mother
said
raskolnikov
irritably
a
it
were
in
spite
of
himself
ah
my
dear
i
don
t
know
what
to
talk
about
broke
from
pulcheria
alexandrovna
why
are
you
all
afraid
of
me
he
asked
with
a
constrained
smile
that
s
certainly
true
said
dounia
looking
directly
and
sternly
at
her
brother
mother
wa
crossing
herself
with
terror
a
she
came
up
the
his
face
worked
a
though
in
convulsion
ach
what
are
you
saying
dounia
don
t
be
angry
please
rodya
why
did
you
say
that
dounia
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
overwhelmed
you
see
coming
here
i
wa
dreaming
all
the
way
in
the
train
how
we
should
meet
how
we
should
talk
over
everything
together
and
i
wa
so
happy
i
did
not
notice
the
journey
but
what
am
i
saying
i
am
happy
now
you
should
not
dounia
i
am
happy
now
simply
in
seeing
you
rodya
hush
mother
he
muttered
in
confusion
not
looking
at
her
but
pressing
her
hand
we
shall
have
time
to
speak
freely
of
everything
a
he
said
this
he
wa
suddenly
overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
turned
pale
again
that
awful
sensation
he
had
known
of
late
passed
with
deadly
chill
over
his
soul
again
it
became
suddenly
plain
and
perceptible
to
him
that
he
had
just
told
a
fearful
lie
that
he
would
never
now
be
able
to
speak
freely
of
everything
that
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
of
anything
to
anyone
the
anguish
of
this
thought
wa
such
that
for
a
moment
he
almost
forgot
himself
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
not
looking
at
anyone
walked
towards
the
door
what
are
you
about
cried
razumihin
clutching
him
by
the
arm
he
sat
down
again
and
began
looking
about
him
in
silence
they
were
all
looking
at
him
in
perplexity
but
what
are
you
all
so
dull
for
he
shouted
suddenly
and
quite
unexpectedly
do
say
something
what
s
the
use
of
sitting
like
this
come
do
speak
let
u
talk
we
meet
together
and
sit
in
silence
come
anything
thank
god
i
wa
afraid
the
same
thing
a
yesterday
wa
beginning
again
said
pulcheria
alexandrovna
crossing
herself
what
is
the
matter
rodya
asked
avdotya
romanovna
distrustfully
oh
nothing
i
remembered
something
he
answered
and
suddenly
laughed
well
if
you
remembered
something
that
s
all
right
i
wa
beginning
to
think
muttered
zossimov
getting
up
from
the
sofa
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
off
i
will
look
in
again
perhaps
if
i
can
he
made
his
bow
and
went
out
what
an
excellent
man
observed
pulcheria
alexandrovna
yes
excellent
splendid
intelligent
raskolnikov
began
suddenly
speaking
with
surprising
rapidity
and
a
liveliness
he
had
not
shown
till
then
i
can
t
remember
where
i
met
him
before
my
illness
i
believe
i
have
met
him
somewhere
and
this
is
a
good
man
too
he
nodded
at
razumihin
do
you
like
him
dounia
he
asked
her
and
suddenly
for
some
unknown
reason
laughed
very
much
answered
dounia
foo
what
a
pig
you
are
razumihin
protested
blushing
in
terrible
confusion
and
he
got
up
from
his
chair
pulcheria
alexandrovna
smiled
faintly
but
raskolnikov
laughed
aloud
where
are
you
off
to
i
must
you
need
not
at
all
stay
zossimov
ha
gone
so
you
must
don
t
go
what
s
the
time
is
it
twelve
o
clock
what
a
pretty
watch
you
have
got
dounia
but
why
are
you
all
silent
again
i
do
all
the
it
wa
a
present
from
marfa
petrovna
answered
dounia
and
a
very
expensive
one
added
pulcheria
alexandrovna
what
a
big
one
hardly
like
a
lady
i
like
that
sort
said
dounia
so
it
is
not
a
present
from
her
thought
razumihin
and
wa
unreasonably
delighted
i
thought
it
wa
luzhin
s
present
observed
raskolnikov
no
he
ha
not
made
dounia
any
present
and
do
you
remember
mother
i
wa
in
love
and
wanted
to
get
married
he
said
suddenly
looking
at
his
mother
who
wa
disconcerted
by
the
sudden
change
of
subject
and
the
way
he
spoke
of
it
oh
yes
my
pulcheria
alexandrovna
exchanged
glance
with
dounia
and
razumihin
h
m
yes
what
shall
i
tell
you
i
don
t
remember
much
indeed
she
wa
such
a
sickly
girl
he
went
on
growing
dreamy
and
looking
down
again
quite
an
invalid
she
wa
fond
of
giving
alms
to
the
poor
and
wa
always
dreaming
of
a
nunnery
and
once
she
burst
into
tear
when
she
began
talking
to
me
about
it
yes
yes
i
remember
i
remember
very
well
she
wa
an
ugly
little
thing
i
really
don
t
know
what
drew
me
to
her
then
i
think
it
wa
because
she
wa
always
ill
if
she
had
been
lame
or
hunchback
i
believe
i
should
have
liked
her
better
still
he
smiled
dreamily
yes
it
wa
a
sort
of
spring
no
it
wa
not
only
spring
delirium
said
dounia
with
warm
feeling
he
fixed
a
strained
intent
look
on
his
sister
but
did
not
hear
or
did
not
understand
her
word
then
completely
lost
in
thought
he
got
up
went
up
to
his
mother
kissed
her
went
back
to
his
place
and
sat
down
you
love
her
even
now
said
pulcheria
alexandrovna
touched
her
now
oh
yes
you
ask
about
her
no
that
s
all
now
a
it
were
in
another
world
and
so
long
ago
and
indeed
everything
happening
here
seems
somehow
far
he
looked
attentively
at
them
you
now
i
seem
to
be
looking
at
you
from
a
thousand
mile
away
but
goodness
know
why
we
are
talking
of
that
and
what
s
the
use
of
asking
about
it
he
added
with
annoyance
and
biting
his
nail
fell
into
dreamy
silence
again
what
a
wretched
lodging
you
have
rodya
it
s
like
a
tomb
said
pulcheria
alexandrovna
suddenly
breaking
the
oppressive
silence
i
am
sure
it
s
quite
half
through
your
lodging
you
have
become
so
my
lodging
he
answered
listlessly
yes
the
lodging
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
i
thought
that
too
if
only
you
knew
though
what
a
strange
thing
you
said
just
now
mother
he
said
laughing
strangely
a
little
more
and
their
companionship
this
mother
and
this
sister
with
him
after
three
year
absence
this
intimate
tone
of
conversation
in
face
of
the
utter
impossibility
of
really
speaking
about
anything
would
have
been
beyond
his
power
of
endurance
but
there
wa
one
urgent
matter
which
must
be
settled
one
way
or
the
other
that
day
so
he
had
decided
when
he
woke
now
he
wa
glad
to
remember
it
a
a
mean
of
escape
listen
dounia
he
began
gravely
and
drily
of
course
i
beg
your
pardon
for
yesterday
but
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
again
that
i
do
not
withdraw
from
my
chief
point
it
is
me
or
luzhin
if
i
am
a
scoundrel
you
must
not
be
one
is
enough
if
you
marry
luzhin
i
cease
at
once
to
look
on
you
a
a
rodya
rodya
it
is
the
same
a
yesterday
again
pulcheria
alexandrovna
cried
mournfully
and
why
do
you
call
yourself
a
scoundrel
i
can
t
bear
it
you
said
the
same
brother
dounia
answered
firmly
and
with
the
same
dryness
in
all
this
there
is
a
mistake
on
your
part
i
thought
it
over
at
night
and
found
out
the
mistake
it
is
all
because
you
seem
to
fancy
i
am
sacrificing
myself
to
someone
and
for
someone
that
is
not
the
case
at
all
i
am
simply
marrying
for
my
own
sake
because
thing
are
hard
for
me
though
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
if
i
succeed
in
being
useful
to
my
family
but
that
is
not
the
chief
motive
for
my
decision
she
is
lying
he
thought
to
himself
biting
his
nail
vindictively
proud
creature
she
won
t
admit
she
want
to
do
it
out
of
charity
too
haughty
oh
base
character
they
even
love
a
though
they
hate
oh
how
i
hate
them
all
in
fact
continued
dounia
i
am
marrying
pyotr
petrovitch
because
of
two
evil
i
choose
the
less
i
intend
to
do
honestly
all
he
expects
of
me
so
i
am
not
deceiving
him
why
did
you
smile
just
now
she
too
flushed
and
there
wa
a
gleam
of
anger
in
her
eye
all
he
asked
with
a
malignant
grin
within
certain
limit
both
the
manner
and
form
of
pyotr
petrovitch
s
courtship
showed
me
at
once
what
he
wanted
he
may
of
course
think
too
well
of
himself
but
i
hope
he
esteem
me
too
why
are
you
laughing
again
and
why
are
you
blushing
again
you
are
lying
sister
you
are
intentionally
lying
simply
from
feminine
obstinacy
simply
to
hold
your
own
against
me
you
can
not
respect
luzhin
i
have
seen
him
and
talked
with
him
so
you
are
selling
yourself
for
money
and
so
in
any
case
you
are
acting
basely
and
i
am
glad
at
least
that
you
can
blush
for
it
is
not
true
i
am
not
lying
cried
dounia
losing
her
composure
i
would
not
marry
him
if
i
were
not
convinced
that
he
esteem
me
and
think
highly
of
me
i
would
not
marry
him
if
i
were
not
firmly
convinced
that
i
can
respect
him
fortunately
i
can
have
convincing
proof
of
it
this
very
day
and
such
a
marriage
is
not
a
vileness
a
you
say
and
even
if
you
were
right
if
i
really
had
determined
on
a
vile
action
is
it
not
merciless
on
your
part
to
speak
to
me
like
that
why
do
you
demand
of
me
a
heroism
that
perhaps
you
have
not
either
it
is
despotism
it
is
tyranny
if
i
ruin
anyone
it
is
only
myself
i
am
not
committing
a
murder
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
why
are
you
so
pale
rodya
darling
what
s
the
matter
good
heaven
you
have
made
him
faint
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
no
no
nonsense
it
s
nothing
a
little
giddiness
not
fainting
you
have
fainting
on
the
brain
h
m
yes
what
wa
i
saying
oh
yes
in
what
way
will
you
get
convincing
proof
that
you
can
respect
him
and
that
he
esteem
you
a
you
said
i
think
you
said
mother
show
rodya
pyotr
petrovitch
s
letter
said
dounia
with
trembling
hand
pulcheria
alexandrovna
gave
him
the
letter
he
took
it
with
great
interest
but
before
opening
it
he
suddenly
looked
with
a
sort
of
wonder
at
dounia
it
is
strange
he
said
slowly
a
though
struck
by
a
new
idea
what
am
i
making
such
a
fuss
for
what
is
it
all
about
marry
whom
you
like
he
said
this
a
though
to
himself
but
said
it
aloud
and
looked
for
some
time
at
his
sister
a
though
puzzled
he
opened
the
letter
at
last
still
with
the
same
look
of
strange
wonder
on
his
face
then
slowly
and
attentively
he
began
reading
and
read
it
through
twice
pulcheria
alexandrovna
showed
marked
anxiety
and
all
indeed
expected
something
particular
what
surprise
me
he
began
after
a
short
pause
handing
the
letter
to
his
mother
but
not
addressing
anyone
in
particular
is
that
he
is
a
business
man
a
lawyer
and
his
conversation
is
pretentious
indeed
and
yet
he
writes
such
an
uneducated
they
all
started
they
had
expected
something
quite
different
but
they
all
write
like
that
you
know
razumihin
observed
abruptly
have
you
read
it
we
showed
him
rodya
we
consulted
him
just
now
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
embarrassed
that
s
just
the
jargon
of
the
court
razumihin
put
in
legal
document
are
written
like
that
to
this
legal
yes
it
s
just
legal
business
language
not
so
very
uneducated
and
not
quite
educated
business
language
pyotr
petrovitch
make
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
had
a
cheap
education
he
is
proud
indeed
of
having
made
his
own
way
avdotya
romanovna
observed
somewhat
offended
by
her
brother
s
tone
well
if
he
s
proud
of
it
he
ha
reason
i
don
t
deny
it
you
seem
to
be
offended
sister
at
my
making
only
such
a
frivolous
criticism
on
the
letter
and
to
think
that
i
speak
of
such
trifling
matter
on
purpose
to
annoy
you
it
is
quite
the
contrary
an
observation
apropos
of
the
style
occurred
to
me
that
is
by
no
mean
irrelevant
a
thing
stand
there
is
one
expression
blame
yourselves
put
in
very
significantly
and
plainly
and
there
is
besides
a
threat
that
he
will
go
away
at
once
if
i
am
present
that
threat
to
go
away
is
equivalent
to
a
threat
to
abandon
you
both
if
you
are
disobedient
and
to
abandon
you
now
after
summoning
you
to
petersburg
well
what
do
you
think
can
one
resent
such
an
expression
from
luzhin
a
we
should
if
he
he
pointed
to
razumihin
had
written
it
or
zossimov
or
one
of
u
answered
dounia
with
more
animation
i
saw
clearly
that
it
wa
too
naïvely
expressed
and
that
perhaps
he
simply
ha
no
skill
in
writing
that
is
a
true
criticism
brother
i
did
not
expect
indeed
it
is
expressed
in
legal
style
and
sound
coarser
than
perhaps
he
intended
but
i
must
disillusion
you
a
little
there
is
one
expression
in
the
letter
one
slander
about
me
and
rather
a
contemptible
one
i
gave
the
money
last
night
to
the
widow
a
woman
in
consumption
crushed
with
trouble
and
not
on
the
pretext
of
the
funeral
but
simply
to
pay
for
the
funeral
and
not
to
the
daughter
a
young
woman
a
he
writes
of
notorious
behaviour
whom
i
saw
last
night
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
but
to
the
widow
in
all
this
i
see
a
too
hasty
desire
to
slander
me
and
to
raise
dissension
between
u
it
is
expressed
again
in
legal
jargon
that
is
to
say
with
a
too
obvious
display
of
the
aim
and
with
a
very
naïve
eagerness
he
is
a
man
of
intelligence
but
to
act
sensibly
intelligence
is
not
enough
it
all
show
the
man
and
i
don
t
think
he
ha
a
great
esteem
for
you
i
tell
you
this
simply
to
warn
you
because
i
sincerely
wish
for
your
good
dounia
did
not
reply
her
resolution
had
been
taken
she
wa
only
awaiting
the
evening
then
what
is
your
decision
rodya
asked
pulcheria
alexandrovna
who
wa
more
uneasy
than
ever
at
the
sudden
new
businesslike
tone
of
his
talk
what
decision
you
see
pyotr
petrovitch
writes
that
you
are
not
to
be
with
u
this
evening
and
that
he
will
go
away
if
you
come
so
will
you
come
that
of
course
is
not
for
me
to
decide
but
for
you
first
if
you
are
not
offended
by
such
a
request
and
secondly
by
dounia
if
she
too
is
not
offended
i
will
do
what
you
think
best
he
added
drily
dounia
ha
already
decided
and
i
fully
agree
with
her
pulcheria
alexandrovna
hastened
to
declare
i
decided
to
ask
you
rodya
to
urge
you
not
to
fail
to
be
with
u
at
this
interview
said
dounia
will
you
come
i
will
ask
you
too
to
be
with
u
at
eight
o
clock
she
said
addressing
razumihin
mother
i
am
inviting
him
quite
right
dounia
well
since
you
have
decided
added
pulcheria
alexandrovna
so
be
it
i
shall
feel
easier
myself
i
do
not
like
concealment
and
deception
better
let
u
have
the
whole
truth
pyotr
petrovitch
may
be
angry
or
not
now
chapter
iv
at
that
moment
the
door
wa
softly
opened
and
a
young
girl
walked
into
the
room
looking
timidly
about
her
everyone
turned
towards
her
with
surprise
and
curiosity
at
first
sight
raskolnikov
did
not
recognise
her
it
wa
sofya
semyonovna
marmeladov
he
had
seen
her
yesterday
for
the
first
time
but
at
such
a
moment
in
such
surroundings
and
in
such
a
dress
that
his
memory
retained
a
very
different
image
of
her
now
she
wa
a
modestly
and
young
girl
very
young
indeed
almost
like
a
child
with
a
modest
and
refined
manner
with
a
candid
but
somewhat
face
she
wa
wearing
a
very
plain
indoor
dress
and
had
on
a
shabby
hat
but
she
still
carried
a
parasol
unexpectedly
finding
the
room
full
of
people
she
wa
not
so
much
embarrassed
a
completely
overwhelmed
with
shyness
like
a
little
child
she
wa
even
about
to
retreat
oh
it
s
you
said
raskolnikov
extremely
astonished
and
he
too
wa
confused
he
at
once
recollected
that
his
mother
and
sister
knew
through
luzhin
s
letter
of
some
young
woman
of
notorious
he
had
only
just
been
protesting
against
luzhin
s
calumny
and
declaring
that
he
had
seen
the
girl
last
night
for
the
first
time
and
suddenly
she
had
walked
in
he
remembered
too
that
he
had
not
protested
against
the
expression
of
notorious
all
this
passed
vaguely
and
fleetingly
through
his
brain
but
looking
at
her
more
intently
he
saw
that
the
humiliated
creature
wa
so
humiliated
that
he
felt
suddenly
sorry
for
her
when
she
made
a
movement
to
retreat
in
terror
it
sent
a
pang
to
his
heart
i
did
not
expect
you
he
said
hurriedly
with
a
look
that
made
her
stop
please
sit
down
you
come
no
doubt
from
katerina
ivanovna
allow
me
not
there
sit
here
at
sonia
s
entrance
razumihin
who
had
been
sitting
on
one
of
raskolnikov
s
three
chair
close
to
the
door
got
up
to
allow
her
to
enter
raskolnikov
had
at
first
shown
her
the
place
on
the
sofa
where
zossimov
had
been
sitting
but
feeling
that
the
sofa
which
served
him
a
a
bed
wa
too
a
place
he
hurriedly
motioned
her
to
razumihin
s
chair
you
sit
here
he
said
to
razumihin
putting
him
on
the
sofa
sonia
sat
down
almost
shaking
with
terror
and
looked
timidly
at
the
two
lady
it
wa
evidently
almost
inconceivable
to
herself
that
she
could
sit
down
beside
them
at
the
thought
of
it
she
wa
so
frightened
that
she
hurriedly
got
up
again
and
in
utter
confusion
addressed
raskolnikov
i
i
have
come
for
one
minute
forgive
me
for
disturbing
you
she
began
falteringly
i
come
from
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
had
no
one
to
send
katerina
ivanovna
told
me
to
beg
you
to
be
at
the
service
in
the
morning
at
mitrofanievsky
and
then
to
u
to
her
to
do
her
the
honour
she
told
me
to
beg
you
sonia
stammered
and
ceased
speaking
i
will
try
certainly
most
certainly
answered
raskolnikov
he
too
stood
up
and
he
too
faltered
and
could
not
finish
his
sentence
please
sit
down
he
said
suddenly
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
are
perhaps
in
a
hurry
but
please
be
so
kind
spare
me
two
minute
and
he
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
sonia
sat
down
again
and
again
timidly
she
took
a
hurried
frightened
look
at
the
two
lady
and
dropped
her
eye
raskolnikov
s
pale
face
flushed
a
shudder
passed
over
him
his
eye
glowed
mother
he
said
firmly
and
insistently
this
is
sofya
semyonovna
marmeladov
the
daughter
of
that
unfortunate
marmeladov
who
wa
run
over
yesterday
before
my
eye
and
of
whom
i
wa
just
telling
pulcheria
alexandrovna
glanced
at
sonia
and
slightly
screwed
up
her
eye
in
spite
of
her
embarrassment
before
rodya
s
urgent
and
challenging
look
she
could
not
deny
herself
that
satisfaction
dounia
gazed
gravely
and
intently
into
the
poor
girl
s
face
and
scrutinised
her
with
perplexity
sonia
hearing
herself
introduced
tried
to
raise
her
eye
again
but
wa
more
embarrassed
than
ever
i
wanted
to
ask
you
said
raskolnikov
hastily
how
thing
were
arranged
yesterday
you
were
not
worried
by
the
police
for
instance
no
that
wa
all
right
it
wa
too
evident
the
cause
of
death
they
did
not
worry
u
only
the
lodger
are
why
at
the
body
s
remaining
so
long
you
see
it
is
hot
now
so
that
they
will
carry
it
to
the
cemetery
into
the
chapel
until
at
first
katerina
ivanovna
wa
unwilling
but
now
she
see
herself
that
it
s
necessary
then
she
begs
you
to
do
u
the
honour
to
be
in
the
church
for
the
service
and
then
to
be
present
at
the
funeral
she
is
giving
a
funeral
lunch
yes
just
a
little
she
told
me
to
thank
you
very
much
for
helping
u
yesterday
but
for
you
we
should
have
had
nothing
for
the
all
at
once
her
lip
and
chin
began
trembling
but
with
an
effort
she
controlled
herself
looking
down
again
during
the
conversation
raskolnikov
watched
her
carefully
she
had
a
thin
very
thin
pale
little
face
rather
irregular
and
angular
with
a
sharp
little
nose
and
chin
she
could
not
have
been
called
pretty
but
her
blue
eye
were
so
clear
and
when
they
lighted
up
there
wa
such
a
kindliness
and
simplicity
in
her
expression
that
one
could
not
help
being
attracted
her
face
and
her
whole
figure
indeed
had
another
peculiar
characteristic
in
spite
of
her
eighteen
year
she
looked
almost
a
little
girl
almost
a
child
and
in
some
of
her
gesture
this
childishness
seemed
almost
absurd
but
ha
katerina
ivanovna
been
able
to
manage
with
such
small
mean
doe
she
even
mean
to
have
a
funeral
lunch
raskolnikov
asked
persistently
keeping
up
the
conversation
the
coffin
will
be
plain
of
course
and
everything
will
be
plain
so
it
won
t
cost
much
katerina
ivanovna
and
i
have
reckoned
it
all
out
so
that
there
will
be
enough
left
and
katerina
ivanovna
wa
very
anxious
it
should
be
so
you
know
one
can
t
it
s
a
comfort
to
her
she
is
like
that
you
know
i
understand
i
understand
of
course
why
do
you
look
at
my
room
like
that
my
mother
ha
just
said
it
is
like
a
you
gave
u
everything
yesterday
sonia
said
suddenly
in
reply
in
a
loud
rapid
whisper
and
again
she
looked
down
in
confusion
her
lip
and
chin
were
trembling
once
more
she
had
been
struck
at
once
by
raskolnikov
s
poor
surroundings
and
now
these
word
broke
out
spontaneously
a
silence
followed
there
wa
a
light
in
dounia
s
eye
and
even
pulcheria
alexandrovna
looked
kindly
at
sonia
rodya
she
said
getting
up
we
shall
have
dinner
together
of
course
come
dounia
and
you
rodya
had
better
go
for
a
little
walk
and
then
rest
and
lie
down
before
you
come
to
see
u
i
am
afraid
we
have
exhausted
you
yes
yes
i
ll
come
he
answered
getting
up
fussily
but
i
have
something
to
see
but
surely
you
will
have
dinner
together
cried
razumihin
looking
in
surprise
at
raskolnikov
what
do
you
mean
yes
yes
i
am
coming
of
course
of
course
and
you
stay
a
minute
you
do
not
want
him
just
now
do
you
mother
or
perhaps
i
am
taking
him
from
you
oh
no
no
and
will
you
dmitri
prokofitch
do
u
the
favour
of
dining
with
u
please
do
added
dounia
razumihin
bowed
positively
radiant
for
one
moment
they
were
all
strangely
embarrassed
rodya
that
is
till
we
meet
i
do
not
like
saying
nastasya
ah
i
have
said
pulcheria
alexandrovna
meant
to
greet
sonia
too
but
it
somehow
failed
to
come
off
and
she
went
in
a
flutter
out
of
the
room
but
avdotya
romanovna
seemed
to
await
her
turn
and
following
her
mother
out
gave
sonia
an
attentive
courteous
bow
sonia
in
confusion
gave
a
hurried
frightened
curtsy
there
wa
a
look
of
poignant
discomfort
in
her
face
a
though
avdotya
romanovna
s
courtesy
and
attention
were
oppressive
and
painful
to
her
dounia
called
raskolnikov
in
the
passage
give
me
your
why
i
did
give
it
to
you
have
you
forgotten
said
dounia
turning
warmly
and
awkwardly
to
him
never
mind
give
it
to
me
and
he
squeezed
her
finger
warmly
dounia
smiled
flushed
pulled
her
hand
away
and
went
off
quite
happy
come
that
s
capital
he
said
to
sonia
going
back
and
looking
brightly
at
her
god
give
peace
to
the
dead
the
living
have
still
to
live
that
is
right
isn
t
it
sonia
looked
surprised
at
the
sudden
brightness
of
his
face
he
looked
at
her
for
some
moment
in
silence
the
whole
history
of
the
dead
father
floated
before
his
memory
in
those
moment
heaven
dounia
pulcheria
alexandrovna
began
a
soon
a
they
were
in
the
street
i
really
feel
relieved
myself
at
coming
away
more
at
ease
how
little
did
i
think
yesterday
in
the
train
that
i
could
ever
be
glad
of
i
tell
you
again
mother
he
is
still
very
don
t
you
see
it
perhaps
worrying
about
u
upset
him
we
must
be
patient
and
much
much
can
be
well
you
were
not
very
patient
pulcheria
alexandrovna
caught
her
up
hotly
and
jealously
do
you
know
dounia
i
wa
looking
at
you
two
you
are
the
very
portrait
of
him
and
not
so
much
in
face
a
in
soul
you
are
both
melancholy
both
morose
and
both
haughty
and
both
generous
surely
he
can
t
be
an
egoist
dounia
eh
when
i
think
of
what
is
in
store
for
u
this
evening
my
heart
sink
don
t
be
uneasy
mother
what
must
be
will
dounia
only
think
what
a
position
we
are
in
what
if
pyotr
petrovitch
break
it
off
poor
pulcheria
alexandrovna
blurted
out
incautiously
he
won
t
be
worth
much
if
he
doe
answered
dounia
sharply
and
contemptuously
we
did
well
to
come
away
pulcheria
alexandrovna
hurriedly
broke
in
he
wa
in
a
hurry
about
some
business
or
other
if
he
get
out
and
ha
a
breath
of
air
it
is
fearfully
close
in
his
room
but
where
is
one
to
get
a
breath
of
air
here
the
very
street
here
feel
like
room
good
heaven
what
a
town
stay
this
side
they
will
crush
you
carrying
something
why
it
is
a
piano
they
have
got
i
declare
how
they
push
i
am
very
much
afraid
of
that
young
woman
what
young
woman
mother
why
that
sofya
semyonovna
who
wa
there
just
why
i
have
a
presentiment
dounia
well
you
may
believe
it
or
not
but
a
soon
a
she
came
in
that
very
minute
i
felt
that
she
wa
the
chief
cause
of
the
trouble
nothing
of
the
sort
cried
dounia
in
vexation
what
nonsense
with
your
presentiment
mother
he
only
made
her
acquaintance
the
evening
before
and
he
did
not
know
her
when
she
came
well
you
will
see
she
worry
me
but
you
will
see
you
will
see
i
wa
so
frightened
she
wa
gazing
at
me
with
those
eye
i
could
scarcely
sit
still
in
my
chair
when
he
began
introducing
her
do
you
remember
it
seems
so
strange
but
pyotr
petrovitch
writes
like
that
about
her
and
he
introduces
her
to
u
to
you
so
he
must
think
a
great
deal
of
people
will
write
anything
we
were
talked
about
and
written
about
too
have
you
forgotten
i
am
sure
that
she
is
a
good
girl
and
that
it
is
all
god
grant
it
may
be
and
pyotr
petrovitch
is
a
contemptible
slanderer
dounia
snapped
out
suddenly
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
crushed
the
conversation
wa
not
resumed
i
will
tell
you
what
i
want
with
you
said
raskolnikov
drawing
razumihin
to
the
window
then
i
will
tell
katerina
ivanovna
that
you
are
coming
sonia
said
hurriedly
preparing
to
depart
one
minute
sofya
semyonovna
we
have
no
secret
you
are
not
in
our
way
i
want
to
have
another
word
or
two
with
you
listen
he
turned
suddenly
to
razumihin
again
you
know
that
what
s
his
name
porfiry
petrovitch
i
should
think
so
he
is
a
relation
why
added
the
latter
with
interest
is
not
he
managing
that
case
you
know
about
that
murder
you
were
speaking
about
it
yes
well
razumihin
s
eye
opened
wide
he
wa
inquiring
for
people
who
had
pawned
thing
and
i
have
some
pledge
there
too
trifle
a
ring
my
sister
gave
me
a
a
keepsake
when
i
left
home
and
my
father
s
silver
watch
they
are
only
worth
five
or
six
rouble
altogether
but
i
value
them
so
what
am
i
to
do
now
i
do
not
want
to
lose
the
thing
especially
the
watch
i
wa
quaking
just
now
for
fear
mother
would
ask
to
look
at
it
when
we
spoke
of
dounia
s
watch
it
is
the
only
thing
of
father
s
left
u
she
would
be
ill
if
it
were
lost
you
know
what
woman
are
so
tell
me
what
to
do
i
know
i
ought
to
have
given
notice
at
the
police
station
but
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
straight
to
porfiry
eh
what
do
you
think
the
matter
might
be
settled
more
quickly
you
see
mother
may
ask
for
it
before
certainly
not
to
the
police
station
certainly
to
porfiry
razumihin
shouted
in
extraordinary
excitement
well
how
glad
i
am
let
u
go
at
once
it
is
a
couple
of
step

glad

different
time

good
if

embarrassed

semyonovna
only

and
avoided
her
eye
sonia
gave
her
address
and
flushed
a
she
did
so
they
all
went
out
together

asked
razumihin
following
him
on
to
the
stair

answered
raskolnikov

have
been
meaning
to
buy
a
lock
for
these
two
year
people

happy
who
have
no
need
of

he
said
laughing
to
sonia
they
stood
still
in
the
gateway
do
you
go
to
the
right
sofya
semyonovna
how
did
you
find

the
way
he
added
a
though
he
wanted
to
say
something
quite
different
he
wanted
to
look
at
her
soft
clear
eye
but

wa
not
easy
why

gave
your
address
to
polenka
polenka

little
girl

and
he

not
know

and

and

i

learnt

name
i
asked
where

did
not

only
a
room
too
i
will
tell
katerina
she
wa
extremely
glad
to
escape
at
last
she
went
away
looking
down
hurrying
to
get
out
of
sight
a
soon
a
possible
to
walk
the
twenty
step
to
the
turning
on
the
right
and
to
be
at
last
alone
and
then
moving
rapidly
along
looking
at
no
one
noticing
nothing
to
think
to
remember
to
meditate
on
every
word
every
detail
never
never
had
she
felt
anything
like
this
dimly
and
unconsciously
a
whole
new
world
wa
opening
before
her
she
remembered
suddenly
that
raskolnikov
meant
to
come
to
her
that
day
perhaps
at
once
only
not
please
not
she
kept
muttering
with
a
sinking
heart
a
though
entreating
someone
like
a
frightened
child
mercy
to
me
to
that
room
he
will
see
oh
dear
she
wa
not
capable
at
that
instant
of
noticing
an
unknown
gentleman
who
wa
watching
her
and
following
at
her
heel
he
had
accompanied
her
from
the
gateway
at
the
moment
when
razumihin
raskolnikov
and
she
stood
still
at
parting
on
the
pavement
this
gentleman
who
wa
just
passing
started
on
hearing
sonia
s
word
and
i
asked
where
raskolnikov
lived
he
turned
a
rapid
but
attentive
look
upon
all
three
especially
upon
raskolnikov
to
whom
sonia
wa
speaking
then
looked
back
and
noted
the
house
all
this
wa
done
in
an
instant
a
he
passed
and
trying
not
to
betray
his
interest
he
walked
on
more
slowly
a
though
waiting
for
something
he
wa
waiting
for
sonia
he
saw
that
they
were
parting
and
that
sonia
wa
going
home
home
where
i
ve
seen
that
face
somewhere
he
thought
i
must
find
at
the
turning
he
crossed
over
looked
round
and
saw
sonia
coming
the
same
way
noticing
nothing
she
turned
the
corner
he
followed
her
on
the
other
side
after
about
fifty
pace
he
crossed
over
again
overtook
her
and
kept
two
or
three
yard
behind
her
he
wa
a
man
about
fifty
rather
tall
and
thickly
set
with
broad
high
shoulder
which
made
him
look
a
though
he
stooped
a
little
he
wore
good
and
fashionable
clothes
and
looked
like
a
gentleman
of
position
he
carried
a
handsome
cane
which
he
tapped
on
the
pavement
at
each
step
his
glove
were
spotless
he
had
a
broad
rather
pleasant
face
with
high
and
a
fresh
colour
not
often
seen
in
petersburg
his
flaxen
hair
wa
still
abundant
and
only
touched
here
and
there
with
grey
and
his
thick
square
beard
wa
even
lighter
than
his
hair
his
eye
were
blue
and
had
a
cold
and
thoughtful
look
his
lip
were
crimson
he
wa
a
remarkedly
man
and
looked
much
younger
than
his
year
when
sonia
came
out
on
the
canal
bank
they
were
the
only
two
person
on
the
pavement
he
observed
her
dreaminess
and
preoccupation
on
reaching
the
house
where
she
lodged
sonia
turned
in
at
the
gate
he
followed
her
seeming
rather
surprised
in
the
courtyard
she
turned
to
the
right
corner
bah
muttered
the
unknown
gentleman
and
mounted
the
stair
behind
her
only
then
sonia
noticed
him
she
reached
the
third
storey
turned
down
the
passage
and
rang
at
no
on
the
door
wa
inscribed
in
chalk
kapernaumov
bah
the
stranger
repeated
again
wondering
at
the
strange
coincidence
and
he
rang
next
door
at
no
the
door
were
two
or
three
yard
apart
you
lodge
at
kapernaumov
s
he
said
looking
at
sonia
and
laughing
he
altered
a
waistcoat
for
me
yesterday
i
am
staying
close
here
at
madame
resslich
s
how
odd
sonia
looked
at
him
attentively
we
are
neighbour
he
went
on
gaily
i
only
came
to
town
the
day
before
yesterday
for
the
sonia
made
no
reply
the
door
opened
and
she
slipped
in
she
felt
for
some
reason
ashamed
and
uneasy
on
the
way
to
porfiry
s
razumihin
wa
obviously
excited
that
s
capital
brother
he
repeated
several
time
and
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
what
are
you
glad
about
raskolnikov
thought
to
himself
i
didn
t
know
that
you
pledged
thing
at
the
old
woman
s
too
and
wa
it
long
ago
i
mean
wa
it
long
since
you
were
there
what
a
fool
he
is
when
wa
it
raskolnikov
stopped
still
to
recollect
two
or
three
day
before
her
death
it
must
have
been
but
i
am
not
going
to
redeem
the
thing
now
he
put
in
with
a
sort
of
hurried
and
conspicuous
solicitude
about
the
thing
i
ve
not
more
than
a
silver
rouble
left
after
last
night
s
accursed
delirium
he
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
delirium
yes
yes
razumihin
hastened
to
agree
with
what
wa
not
clear
then
that
s
why
you
were
stuck
partly
you
know
in
your
delirium
you
were
continually
mentioning
some
ring
or
chain
yes
yes
that
s
clear
it
s
all
clear
hullo
how
that
idea
must
have
got
about
among
them
here
this
man
will
go
to
the
stake
for
me
and
i
find
him
delighted
at
having
it
why
i
spoke
of
ring
in
my
delirium
what
a
hold
the
idea
must
have
on
all
of
them
shall
we
find
him
he
asked
suddenly
oh
yes
razumihin
answered
quickly
he
is
a
nice
fellow
you
will
see
brother
rather
clumsy
that
is
to
say
he
is
a
man
of
polished
manner
but
i
mean
clumsy
in
a
different
sense
he
is
an
intelligent
fellow
very
much
so
indeed
but
he
ha
his
own
range
of
idea
he
is
incredulous
sceptical
cynical
he
like
to
impose
on
people
or
rather
to
make
fun
of
them
his
is
the
old
circumstantial
method
but
he
understands
his
work
thoroughly
last
year
he
cleared
up
a
case
of
murder
in
which
the
police
had
hardly
a
clue
he
is
very
very
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
on
what
ground
is
he
so
anxious
oh
it
s
not
exactly
you
see
since
you
ve
been
ill
i
happen
to
have
mentioned
you
several
time
so
when
he
heard
about
you
about
your
being
a
law
student
and
not
able
to
finish
your
study
he
said
what
a
pity
and
so
i
concluded
from
everything
together
not
only
that
yesterday
zametov
you
know
rodya
i
talked
some
nonsense
on
the
way
home
to
you
yesterday
when
i
wa
drunk
i
am
afraid
brother
of
your
exaggerating
it
you
what
that
they
think
i
am
a
madman
maybe
they
are
right
he
said
with
a
constrained
smile
yes
yes
that
is
pooh
no
but
all
that
i
said
and
there
wa
something
else
too
it
wa
all
nonsense
drunken
but
why
are
you
apologising
i
am
so
sick
of
it
all
raskolnikov
cried
with
exaggerated
irritability
it
wa
partly
assumed
however
i
know
i
know
i
understand
believe
me
i
understand
one
s
ashamed
to
speak
of
if
you
are
ashamed
then
don
t
speak
of
both
were
silent
razumihin
wa
more
than
ecstatic
and
raskolnikov
perceived
it
with
repulsion
he
wa
alarmed
too
by
what
razumihin
had
just
said
about
porfiry
i
shall
have
to
pull
a
long
face
with
him
too
he
thought
with
a
beating
heart
and
he
turned
white
and
do
it
naturally
too
but
the
most
natural
thing
would
be
to
do
nothing
at
all
carefully
do
nothing
at
all
no
would
not
be
natural
again
oh
well
we
shall
see
how
it
turn
out
we
shall
see
directly
is
it
a
good
thing
to
go
or
not
the
butterfly
fly
to
the
light
my
heart
is
beating
that
s
what
s
bad
in
this
grey
house
said
razumihin
the
most
important
thing
doe
porfiry
know
that
i
wa
at
the
old
hag
s
flat
yesterday
and
asked
about
the
blood
i
must
find
that
out
instantly
a
soon
a
i
go
in
find
out
from
his
face
otherwise
i
ll
find
out
if
it
s
my
i
say
brother
he
said
suddenly
addressing
razumihin
with
a
sly
smile
i
have
been
noticing
all
day
that
you
seem
to
be
curiously
excited
isn
t
it
so
excited
not
a
bit
of
it
said
razumihin
stung
to
the
quick
yes
brother
i
assure
you
it
s
noticeable
why
you
sat
on
your
chair
in
a
way
you
never
do
sit
on
the
edge
somehow
and
you
seemed
to
be
writhing
all
the
time
you
kept
jumping
up
for
nothing
one
moment
you
were
angry
and
the
next
your
face
looked
like
a
sweetmeat
you
even
blushed
especially
when
you
were
invited
to
dinner
you
blushed
nothing
of
the
sort
nonsense
what
do
you
mean
but
why
are
you
wriggling
out
of
it
like
a
schoolboy
by
jove
there
he
s
blushing
what
a
pig
you
are
but
why
are
you
so
shamefaced
about
it
romeo

tell
of
you
i
ll
make
mother
laugh
and
someone

this
is
serious
what
next
you
fiend
razumihin
wa
utterly
overwhelmed
turning
cold
with
horror
what
will
you
tell
them
come
brother
foo
what
a
pig
you

you

how

you

romeo
over
six
foot
high
and
how
you
ve
washed
you
cleaned
your
nail
i
declare
eh

a
though
he
could
not
restrain
himself
so
laughing
they
entered
porfiry
petrovitch
s
flat
this
is
what
raskolnikov
wanted
from
within
they
could
be
heard
laughing

they
came
in

guffawing
in
the

he
had
the
utmost
difficulty
not
to
burst
out
laughing
again
behind

strode
in
gawky
and
awkward
shamefaced
and
red
a
a
peony
with
an
utterly
crestfallen
and
ferocious
expression
his
face
and
whole
figure
really
were
ridiculous
at
that
moment
and
amply
justified
raskolnikov
s
laughter
raskolnikov
not
waiting
for
an
introduction
bowed
to
porfiry

who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
looking
inquiringly
at
them
he
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
hand
still
apparently
making
desperate
effort
to
subdue
his
mirth
and
utter
a
few
word
to
introduce
himself
but
he
had
no
sooner
succeeded
in
assuming
a
serious
air
and
muttering
something
when
he
suddenly
glanced
again
a
though
accidentally
at
razumihin
and
could
no
longer
control
himself
his
stifled
laughter
broke
out
the
more
irresistibly
the
more
he
tried
to
restrain
it
the
extraordinary
ferocity
with
which
razumihin
received
this
spontaneous
mirth
gave
the
whole
scene
the
appearance
of
most
genuine
fun
and
naturalness
razumihin
strengthened
this
impression

roared
waving
his
arm

at

struck

round

empty

put

confusion

at

laughing
but
obviously
looked
for
explanation
zametov
had
been
sitting
in
the
corner
but
he
rose
at
the
visitor
entrance
and
wa
standing
in
expectation
with
a
smile
on
his
lip
though
he
looked
with
surprise
and
even
it
seemed
incredulity
at
the
whole
scene
and
at
raskolnikov
with
a
certain
embarrassment
zametov
s
unexpected
presence
struck
raskolnikov
unpleasantly
i
ve
got
to
think
of
that
he
thought
excuse
me
please
he
began
affecting
extreme
embarrassment
not
at
all
very
pleasant
to
see
you
and
how
pleasantly
you
ve
come
in
why
won
t
he
even
say
porfiry
petrovitch
nodded
at
razumihin
upon
my
honour
i
don
t
know
why
he
is
in
such
a
rage
with
me
i
only
told
him
a
we
came
along
that
he
wa
like
romeo
and
proved
it
and
that
wa
all
i
think
pig
ejaculated
razumihin
without
turning
round
there
must
have
been
very
grave
ground
for
it
if
he
is
so
furious
at
the
word
porfiry
laughed
oh
you
sharp
lawyer
damn
you
all
snapped
razumihin
and
suddenly
bursting
out
laughing
himself
he
went
up
to
porfiry
with
a
more
cheerful
face
a
though
nothing
had
happened
that
ll
do
we
are
all
fool
to
come
to
business
this
is
my
friend
rodion
romanovitch
raskolnikov
in
the
first
place
he
ha
heard
of
you
and
want
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
secondly
he
ha
a
little
matter
of
business
with
you
bah
zametov
what
brought
you
here
have
you
met
before
have
you
known
each
other
long
what
doe
this
mean
thought
raskolnikov
uneasily
zametov
seemed
taken
aback
but
not
very
much
so
why
it
wa
at
your
room
we
met
yesterday
he
said
easily
then
i
have
been
spared
the
trouble
all
last
week
he
wa
begging
me
to
introduce
him
to
you
porfiry
and
you
have
sniffed
each
other
out
without
me
where
is
your
tobacco
porfiry
petrovitch
wa
wearing
a
very
clean
linen
and
slipper
he
wa
a
man
of
about
five
and
thirty
short
stout
even
to
corpulence
and
clean
shaven
he
wore
his
hair
cut
short
and
had
a
large
round
head
particularly
prominent
at
the
back
his
soft
round
rather
face
wa
of
a
sickly
yellowish
colour
but
had
a
vigorous
and
rather
ironical
expression
it
would
have
been
except
for
a
look
in
the
eye
which
shone
with
a
watery
mawkish
light
under
almost
white
blinking
eyelash
the
expression
of
those
eye
wa
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
his
somewhat
womanish
figure
and
gave
it
something
far
more
serious
than
could
be
guessed
at
first
sight
a
soon
a
porfiry
petrovitch
heard
that
his
visitor
had
a
little
matter
of
business
with
him
he
begged
him
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
and
sat
down
himself
on
the
other
end
waiting
for
him
to
explain
his
business
with
that
careful
and
attention
which
is
at
once
oppressive
and
embarrassing
especially
to
a
stranger
and
especially
if
what
you
are
discussing
is
in
your
opinion
of
far
too
little
importance
for
such
exceptional
solemnity
but
in
brief
and
coherent
phrase
raskolnikov
explained
his
business
clearly
and
exactly
and
wa
so
well
satisfied
with
himself
that
he
even
succeeded
in
taking
a
good
look
at
porfiry
porfiry
petrovitch
did
not
once
take
his
eye
off
him
razumihin
sitting
opposite
at
the
same
table
listened
warmly
and
impatiently
looking
from
one
to
the
other
every
moment
with
rather
excessive
interest
fool
raskolnikov
swore
to
himself
you
have
to
give
information
to
the
police
porfiry
replied
with
a
most
businesslike
air
that
having
learnt
of
this
incident
that
is
of
the
murder
you
beg
to
inform
the
lawyer
in
charge
of
the
case
that
such
and
such
thing
belong
to
you
and
that
you
desire
to
redeem
them
or
but
they
will
write
to
that
s
just
the
point
that
at
the
present
moment
raskolnikov
tried
his
utmost
to
feign
embarrassment
i
am
not
quite
in
fund
and
even
this
trifling
sum
is
beyond
me
i
only
wanted
you
see
for
the
present
to
declare
that
the
thing
are
mine
and
that
when
i
have
money
that
s
no
matter
answered
porfiry
petrovitch
receiving
his
explanation
of
his
pecuniary
position
coldly
but
you
can
if
you
prefer
write
straight
to
me
to
say
that
having
been
informed
of
the
matter
and
claiming
such
and
such
a
your
property
you
beg
on
an
ordinary
sheet
of
paper
raskolnikov
interrupted
eagerly
again
interested
in
the
financial
side
of
the
question
oh
the
most
ordinary
and
suddenly
porfiry
petrovitch
looked
with
obvious
irony
at
him
screwing
up
his
eye
and
a
it
were
winking
at
him
but
perhaps
it
wa
raskolnikov
s
fancy
for
it
all
lasted
but
a
moment
there
wa
certainly
something
of
the
sort
raskolnikov
could
have
sworn
he
winked
at
him
goodness
know
why
he
know
flashed
through
his
mind
like
lightning
forgive
my
troubling
you
about
such
trifle
he
went
on
a
little
disconcerted
the
thing
are
only
worth
five
rouble
but
i
prize
them
particularly
for
the
sake
of
those
from
whom
they
came
to
me
and
i
must
confess
that
i
wa
alarmed
when
i
heard
that
s
why
you
were
so
much
struck
when
i
mentioned
to
zossimov
that
porfiry
wa
inquiring
for
everyone
who
had
pledge
razumihin
put
in
with
obvious
intention
this
wa
really
unbearable
raskolnikov
could
not
help
glancing
at
him
with
a
flash
of
vindictive
anger
in
his
black
eye
but
immediately
recollected
himself
you
seem
to
be
jeering
at
me
brother
he
said
to
him
with
a
irritability
i
dare
say
i
do
seem
to
you
absurdly
anxious
about
such
trash
but
you
mustn
t
think
me
selfish
or
grasping
for
that
and
these
two
thing
may
be
anything
but
trash
in
my
eye
i
told
you
just
now
that
the
silver
watch
though
it
s
not
worth
a
cent
is
the
only
thing
left
u
of
my
father
s
you
may
laugh
at
me
but
my
mother
is
here
he
turned
suddenly
to
porfiry
and
if
she
knew
he
turned
again
hurriedly
to
razumihin
carefully
making
his
voice
tremble
that
the
watch
wa
lost
she
would
be
in
despair
you
know
what
woman
are
not
a
bit
of
it
i
didn
t
mean
that
at
all
quite
the
contrary
shouted
razumihin
distressed
wa
it
right
wa
it
natural
did
i
overdo
it
raskolnikov
asked
himself
in
a
tremor
why
did
i
say
that
about
woman
oh
your
mother
is
with
you
porfiry
petrovitch
inquired
when
did
she
come
last
porfiry
paused
a
though
reflecting
your
thing
would
not
in
any
case
be
lost
he
went
on
calmly
and
coldly
i
have
been
expecting
you
here
for
some
and
a
though
that
wa
a
matter
of
no
importance
he
carefully
offered
the
to
razumihin
who
wa
ruthlessly
scattering
cigarette
ash
over
the
carpet
raskolnikov
shuddered
but
porfiry
did
not
seem
to
be
looking
at
him
and
wa
still
concerned
with
razumihin
s
cigarette
what
expecting
him
why
did
you
know
that
he
had
pledge
cried
razumihin
porfiry
petrovitch
addressed
himself
to
raskolnikov
your
thing
the
ring
and
the
watch
were
wrapped
up
together
and
on
the
paper
your
name
wa
legibly
written
in
pencil
together
with
the
date
on
which
you
left
them
with
her
how
observant
you
are
raskolnikov
smiled
awkwardly
doing
his
very
utmost
to
look
him
straight
in
the
face
but
he
failed
and
suddenly
added
i
say
that
because
i
suppose
there
were
a
great
many
pledge
that
it
must
be
difficult
to
remember
them
all
but
you
remember
them
all
so
clearly
and
and
stupid
feeble
he
thought
why
did
i
add
that
but
we
know
all
who
had
pledge
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
hasn
t
come
forward
porfiry
answered
with
hardly
perceptible
irony
i
haven
t
been
quite
i
heard
that
too
i
heard
indeed
that
you
were
in
great
distress
about
something
you
look
pale
i
am
not
pale
at
all
no
i
am
quite
well
raskolnikov
snapped
out
rudely
and
angrily
completely
changing
his
tone
his
anger
wa
mounting
he
could
not
repress
it
and
in
my
anger
i
shall
betray
myself
flashed
through
his
mind
again
why
are
they
torturing
me
not
quite
well
razumihin
caught
him
up
what
next
he
wa
unconscious
and
delirious
all
yesterday
would
you
believe
porfiry
a
soon
a
our
back
were
turned
he
dressed
though
he
could
hardly
stand
and
gave
u
the
slip
and
went
off
on
a
spree
somewhere
till
midnight
delirious
all
the
time
would
you
believe
it
extraordinary
really
delirious
you
don
t
say
so
porfiry
shook
his
head
in
a
womanish
way
nonsense
don
t
you
believe
it
but
you
don
t
believe
it
anyway
raskolnikov
let
slip
in
his
anger
but
porfiry
petrovitch
did
not
seem
to
catch
those
strange
word
but
how
could
you
have
gone
out
if
you
hadn
t
been
delirious
razumihin
got
hot
suddenly
what
did
you
go
out
for
what
wa
the
object
of
it
and
why
on
the
sly
were
you
in
your
sens
when
you
did
it
now
that
all
danger
is
over
i
can
speak
i
wa
awfully
sick
of
them
raskolnikov
addressed
porfiry
suddenly
with
a
smile
of
insolent
defiance
i
ran
away
from
them
to
take
lodging
where
they
wouldn
t
find
me
and
took
a
lot
of
money
with
me
zametov
there
saw
it
i
say
zametov
wa
i
sensible
or
delirious
yesterday
settle
our
he
could
have
strangled
zametov
at
that
moment
so
hateful
were
his
expression
and
his
silence
to
him
in
my
opinion
you
talked
sensibly
and
even
artfully
but
you
were
extremely
irritable
zametov
pronounced
dryly
and
nikodim
fomitch
wa
telling
me
put
in
porfiry
petrovitch
that
he
met
you
very
late
last
night
in
the
lodging
of
a
man
who
had
been
run
and
there
said
razumihin
weren
t
you
mad
then
you
gave
your
last
penny
to
the
widow
for
the
funeral
if
you
wanted
to
help
give
fifteen
or
twenty
even
but
keep
three
rouble
for
yourself
at
least
but
he
flung
away
all
the
at
once
maybe
i
found
a
treasure
somewhere
and
you
know
nothing
of
it
so
that
s
why
i
wa
liberal
yesterday
zametov
know
i
ve
found
a
treasure
excuse
u
please
for
disturbing
you
for
half
an
hour
with
such
triviality
he
said
turning
to
porfiry
petrovitch
with
trembling
lip
we
are
boring
you
aren
t
we
oh
no
quite
the
contrary
quite
the
contrary
if
only
you
knew
how
you
interest
me
it
s
interesting
to
look
on
and
listen
and
i
am
really
glad
you
have
come
forward
at
but
you
might
give
u
some
tea
my
throat
s
dry
cried
razumihin
capital
idea
perhaps
we
will
all
keep
you
company
wouldn
t
you
like
something
more
essential
before
tea
get
along
with
you
porfiry
petrovitch
went
out
to
order
tea
raskolnikov
s
thought
were
in
a
whirl
he
wa
in
terrible
exasperation
the
worst
of
it
is
they
don
t
disguise
it
they
don
t
care
to
stand
on
ceremony
and
how
if
you
didn
t
know
me
at
all
did
you
come
to
talk
to
nikodim
fomitch
about
me
so
they
don
t
care
to
hide
that
they
are
tracking
me
like
a
pack
of
dog
they
simply
spit
in
my
he
wa
shaking
with
rage
come
strike
me
openly
don
t
play
with
me
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
it
s
hardly
civil
porfiry
petrovitch
but
perhaps
i
won
t
allow
it
i
shall
get
up
and
throw
the
whole
truth
in
your
ugly
face
and
you
ll
see
how
i
despise
he
could
hardly
breathe
and
what
if
it
s
only
my
fancy
what
if
i
am
mistaken
and
through
inexperience
i
get
angry
and
don
t
keep
up
my
nasty
part
perhaps
it
s
all
unintentional
all
their
phrase
are
the
usual
one
but
there
is
something
about

all
might
be
said
but
there
is
something
why
did
he
say
bluntly
with
her
why
did
zametov
add
that
i
spoke
artfully
why
do
they
speak
in
that
tone
yes
the
tone
razumihin
is
sitting
here
why
doe
he
see
nothing
that
innocent
blockhead
never
doe
see
anything
feverish
again
did
porfiry
wink
at
me
just
now
of
course
it
s
nonsense
what
could
he
wink
for
are
they
trying
to
upset
my
nerve
or
are
they
teasing
me
either
it
s
ill
fancy
or
they
know
even
zametov
is
rude
is
zametov
rude
zametov
ha
changed
his
mind
i
foresaw
he
would
change
his
mind
he
is
at
home
here
while
it
s
my
first
visit
porfiry
doe
not
consider
him
a
visitor
sits
with
his
back
to
him
they
re
a
thick
a
thief
no
doubt
over
me
not
a
doubt
they
were
talking
about
me
before
we
came
do
they
know
about
the
flat
if
only
they
d
make
haste
when
i
said
that
i
ran
away
to
take
a
flat
he
let
it
pas
i
put
that
in
cleverly
about
a
flat
it
may
be
of
use
afterwards
delirious
indeed
he
know
all
about
last
night
he
didn
t
know
of
my
mother
s
arrival
the
hag
had
written
the
date
on
in
pencil
you
are
wrong
you
won
t
catch
me
there
are
no
fact
it
s
all
supposition
you
produce
fact
the
flat
even
isn
t
a
fact
but
delirium
i
know
what
to
say
to
them
do
they
know
about
the
flat
i
won
t
go
without
finding
out
what
did
i
come
for
but
my
being
angry
now
maybe
is
a
fact
fool
how
irritable
i
am
perhaps
that
s
right
to
play
the
invalid
he
is
feeling
me
he
will
try
to
catch
me
why
did
i
come
all
this
flashed
like
lightning
through
his
mind
porfiry
petrovitch
returned
quickly
he
became
suddenly
more
jovial
your
party
yesterday
brother
ha
left
my
head
rather
and
i
am
out
of
sort
altogether
he
began
in
quite
a
different
tone
laughing
to
razumihin
wa
it
interesting
i
left
you
yesterday
at
the
most
interesting
point
who
got
the
best
of
it
oh
no
one
of
course
they
got
on
to
everlasting
question
floated
off
into
only
fancy
rodya
what
we
got
on
to
yesterday
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
a
crime
i
told
you
that
we
talked
our
head
what
is
there
strange
it
s
an
everyday
social
question
raskolnikov
answered
casually
the
question
wasn
t
put
quite
like
that
observed
porfiry
not
quite
that
s
true
razumihin
agreed
at
once
getting
warm
and
hurried
a
usual
listen
rodion
and
tell
u
your
opinion
i
want
to
hear
it
i
wa
fighting
tooth
and
nail
with
them
and
wanted
you
to
help
me
i
told
them
you
were
coming
it
began
with
the
socialist
doctrine
you
know
their
doctrine
crime
is
a
protest
against
the
abnormality
of
the
social
organisation
and
nothing
more
and
nothing
more
no
other
cause
admitted
you
are
wrong
there
cried
porfiry
petrovitch
he
wa
noticeably
animated
and
kept
laughing
a
he
looked
at
razumihin
which
made
him
more
excited
than
ever
nothing
is
admitted
razumihin
interrupted
with
heat
i
am
not
wrong
i
ll
show
you
their
pamphlet
everything
with
them
is
the
influence
of
environment
and
nothing
else
their
favourite
phrase
from
which
it
follows
that
if
society
is
normally
organised
all
crime
will
cease
at
once
since
there
will
be
nothing
to
protest
against
and
all
men
will
become
righteous
in
one
instant
human
nature
is
not
taken
into
account
it
is
excluded
it
s
not
supposed
to
exist
they
don
t
recognise
that
humanity
developing
by
a
historical
living
process
will
become
at
last
a
normal
society
but
they
believe
that
a
social
system
that
ha
come
out
of
some
mathematical
brain
is
going
to
organise
all
humanity
at
once
and
make
it
just
and
sinless
in
an
instant
quicker
than
any
living
process
that
s
why
they
instinctively
dislike
history
nothing
but
ugliness
and
stupidity
in
it
and
they
explain
it
all
a
stupidity
that
s
why
they
so
dislike
the
process
of
life
they
don
t
want
a
the
living
soul
demand
life
the
soul
won
t
obey
the
rule
of
mechanic
the
soul
is
an
object
of
suspicion
the
soul
is
retrograde
but
what
they
want
though
it
smell
of
death
and
can
be
made
of
at
least
is
not
alive
ha
no
will
is
servile
and
won
t
revolt
and
it
come
in
the
end
to
their
reducing
everything
to
the
building
of
wall
and
the
planning
of
room
and
passage
in
a
phalanstery
the
phalanstery
is
ready
indeed
but
your
human
nature
is
not
ready
for
the
phalanstery
it
want
life
it
hasn
t
completed
it
vital
process
it
s
too
soon
for
the
graveyard
you
can
t
skip
over
nature
by
logic
logic
presupposes
three
possibility
but
there
are
million
cut
away
a
million
and
reduce
it
all
to
the
question
of
comfort
that
s
the
easiest
solution
of
the
problem
it
s
seductively
clear
and
you
musn
t
think
about
it
that
s
the
great
thing
you
mustn
t
think
the
whole

porfiry
can
you
imagine
he
turned
to
raskolnikov
six
people
holding
forth
like
that
last
night
in
one
room
with
punch

preliminary
no

for
a
great
deal
in

i
can
assure
you
of
oh
i

just
tell
me
a
man
of
forty
violates
a
child
of
ten
wa
it
environment
drove
him
to
it
well
strictly
speaking
it
did
porfiry
observed
with
noteworthy
gravity
a
crime
of
that
nature
may
be
very
well
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
razumihin
wa
almost
in
a
frenzy
oh
if
you
like
he
roared
i
ll
prove
to
you
that
your
white
eyelash
may
very
well
be
ascribed
to
the
church
of
ivan
the
great
s
being
two
hundred
and
fifty
foot
high
and
i
will
prove
it
clearly
exactly
progressively
and
even
with
a
liberal
tendency
i
undertake
to
will
you
bet
on
it
done
let
s
hear
please
how
he
will
prove
it
he
is
always
humbugging
confound
him
cried
razumihin
jumping
up
and
gesticulating
what
s
the
use
of
talking
to
you
he
doe
all
that
on
purpose
you
don
t
know
him
rodion
he
took
their
side
yesterday
simply
to
make
fool
of
them
and
the
thing
he
said
yesterday
and
they
were
delighted
he
can
keep
it
up
for
a
fortnight
together
last
year
he
persuaded
u
that
he
wa
going
into
a
monastery
he
stuck
to
it
for
two
month
not
long
ago
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
declare
he
wa
going
to
get
married
that
he
had
everything
ready
for
the
wedding
he
ordered
new
clothes
indeed
we
all
began
to
congratulate
him
there
wa
no
bride
nothing
all
pure
fantasy
ah
you
are
wrong
i
got
the
clothes
before
it
wa
the
new
clothes
in
fact
that
made
me
think
of
taking
you
are
you
such
a
good
dissembler
raskolnikov
asked
carelessly
you
wouldn
t
have
supposed
it
eh
wait
a
bit
i
shall
take
you
in
too
no
i
ll
tell
you
the
truth
all
these
question
about
crime
environment
child
recall
to
my
mind
an
article
of
yours
which
interested
me
at
the
time
on
crime
or
something
of
the
sort
i
forget
the
title
i
read
it
with
pleasure
two
month
ago
in
the
my
article
in
the
raskolnikov
asked
in
astonishment
i
certainly
did
write
an
article
upon
a
book
six
month
ago
when
i
left
the
university
but
i
sent
it
to
the
but
it
came
out
in
the
and
the
ceased
to
exist
so
that
s
why
it
wasn
t
printed
at
the
that
s
true
but
when
it
ceased
to
exist
the
wa
amalgamated
with
the
and
so
your
article
appeared
two
month
ago
in
the
latter
didn
t
you
know
raskolnikov
had
not
known
why
you
might
get
some
money
out
of
them
for
the
article
what
a
strange
person
you
are
you
lead
such
a
solitary
life
that
you
know
nothing
of
matter
that
concern
you
directly
it
s
a
fact
i
assure
bravo
rodya
i
knew
nothing
about
it
either
cried
razumihin
i
ll
run
to
the
and
ask
for
the
number
two
month
ago
what
wa
the
date
it
doesn
t
matter
though
i
will
find
it
think
of
not
telling
u
how
did
you
find
out
that
the
article
wa
mine
it
s
only
signed
with
an
i
only
learnt
it
by
chance
the
other
day
through
the
editor
i
know
him
i
wa
very
much
i
analysed
if
i
remember
the
psychology
of
a
criminal
before
and
after
the
yes
and
you
maintained
that
the
perpetration
of
a
crime
is
always
accompanied
by
illness
very
very
original
but
it
wa
not
that
part
of
your
article
that
interested
me
so
much
but
an
idea
at
the
end
of
the
article
which
i
regret
to
say
you
merely
suggested
without
working
it
out
clearly
there
is
if
you
recollect
a
suggestion
that
there
are
certain
person
who
can
that
is
not
precisely
are
able
to
but
have
a
perfect
right
to
commit
breach
of
morality
and
crime
and
that
the
law
is
not
for
raskolnikov
smiled
at
the
exaggerated
and
intentional
distortion
of
his
idea
what
what
do
you
mean
a
right
to
crime
but
not
because
of
the
influence
of
environment
razumihin
inquired
with
some
alarm
even
no
not
exactly
because
of
it
answered
porfiry
in
his
article
all
men
are
divided
into
ordinary
and
ordinary
men
have
to
live
in
submission
have
no
right
to
transgress
the
law
because
don
t
you
see
they
are
ordinary
but
extraordinary
men
have
a
right
to
commit
any
crime
and
to
transgress
the
law
in
any
way
just
because
they
are
extraordinary
that
wa
your
idea
if
i
am
not
mistaken
what
do
you
mean
that
can
t
be
right
razumihin
muttered
in
bewilderment
raskolnikov
smiled
again
he
saw
the
point
at
once
and
knew
where
they
wanted
to
drive
him
he
decided
to
take
up
the
challenge
that
wasn
t
quite
my
contention
he
began
simply
and
modestly
yet
i
admit
that
you
have
stated
it
almost
correctly
perhaps
if
you
like
perfectly
it
almost
gave
him
pleasure
to
admit
this
the
only
difference
is
that
i
don
t
contend
that
extraordinary
people
are
always
bound
to
commit
breach
of
moral
a
you
call
it
in
fact
i
doubt
whether
such
an
argument
could
be
published
i
simply
hinted
that
an
extraordinary
man
ha
the
right
that
is
not
an
official
right
but
an
inner
right
to
decide
in
his
own
conscience
to
overstep
certain
obstacle
and
only
in
case
it
is
essential
for
the
practical
fulfilment
of
his
idea
sometimes
perhaps
of
benefit
to
the
whole
of
humanity
you
say
that
my
article
isn
t
definite
i
am
ready
to
make
it
a
clear
a
i
can
perhaps
i
am
right
in
thinking
you
want
me
to
very
well
i
maintain
that
if
the
discovery
of
kepler
and
newton
could
not
have
been
made
known
except
by
sacrificing
the
life
of
one
a
dozen
a
hundred
or
more
men
newton
would
have
had
the
right
would
indeed
have
been
in
to
the
dozen
or
the
hundred
men
for
the
sake
of
making
his
discovery
known
to
the
whole
of
humanity
but
it
doe
not
follow
from
that
that
newton
had
a
right
to
murder
people
right
and
left
and
to
steal
every
day
in
the
market
then
i
remember
i
maintain
in
my
article
that
all
well
legislator
and
leader
of
men
such
a
lycurgus
solon
mahomet
napoleon
and
so
on
were
all
without
exception
criminal
from
the
very
fact
that
making
a
new
law
they
transgressed
the
ancient
one
handed
down
from
their
ancestor
and
held
sacred
by
the
people
and
they
did
not
stop
short
at
bloodshed
either
if
that
bloodshed
often
of
innocent
person
fighting
bravely
in
defence
of
ancient
law
were
of
use
to
their
cause
it
s
remarkable
in
fact
that
the
majority
indeed
of
these
benefactor
and
leader
of
humanity
were
guilty
of
terrible
carnage
in
short
i
maintain
that
all
great
men
or
even
men
a
little
out
of
the
common
that
is
to
say
capable
of
giving
some
new
word
must
from
their
very
nature
be
criminal
more
or
less
of
course
otherwise
it
s
hard
for
them
to
get
out
of
the
common
rut
and
to
remain
in
the
common
rut
is
what
they
can
t
submit
to
from
their
very
nature
again
and
to
my
mind
they
ought
not
indeed
to
submit
to
it
you
see
that
there
is
nothing
particularly
new
in
all
that
the
same
thing
ha
been
printed
and
read
a
thousand
time
before
a
for
my
division
of
people
into
ordinary
and
extraordinary
i
acknowledge
that
it
s
somewhat
arbitrary
but
i
don
t
insist
upon
exact
number
i
only
believe
in
my
leading
idea
that
men
are
divided
by
a
law
of
nature
into
two
category
inferior
ordinary
that
is
so
to
say
material
that
serf
only
to
reproduce
it
kind
and
men
who
have
the
gift
or
the
talent
to
utter
new
there
are
of
course
innumerable
but
the
distinguishing
feature
of
both
category
are
fairly
well
marked
the
first
category
generally
speaking
are
men
conservative
in
temperament
and
they
live
under
control
and
love
to
be
controlled
to
my
thinking
it
is
their
duty
to
be
controlled
because
that
s
their
vocation
and
there
is
nothing
humiliating
in
it
for
them
the
second
category
all
transgress
the
law
they
are
destroyer
or
disposed
to
destruction
according
to
their
capacity
the
crime
of
these
men
are
of
course
relative
and
varied
for
the
most
part
they
seek
in
very
varied
way
the
destruction
of
the
present
for
the
sake
of
the
better
but
if
such
a
one
is
forced
for
the
sake
of
his
idea
to
step
over
a
corpse
or
wade
through
blood
he
can
i
maintain
find
within
himself
in
his
conscience
a
sanction
for
wading
through
blood
that
depends
on
the
idea
and
it
dimension
note
that
it
s
only
in
that
sense
i
speak
of
their
right
to
crime
in
my
article
you
remember
it
began
with
the
legal
question
there
s
no
need
for
such
anxiety
however
the
mass
will
scarcely
ever
admit
this
right
they
punish
them
or
hang
them
more
or
less
and
in
doing
so
fulfil
quite
justly
their
conservative
vocation
but
the
same
mass
set
these
criminal
on
a
pedestal
in
the
next
generation
and
worship
them
more
or
less
the
first
category
is
always
the
man
of
the
present
the
second
the
man
of
the
future
the
first
preserve
the
world
and
people
it
the
second
move
the
world
and
lead
it
to
it
goal
each
class
ha
an
equal
right
to
exist
in
fact
all
have
equal
right
with
me
and
la
guerre
till
the
new
jerusalem
of
course
then
you
believe
in
the
new
jerusalem
do
you
i
do
raskolnikov
answered
firmly
a
he
said
these
word
and
during
the
whole
preceding
tirade
he
kept
his
eye
on
one
spot
on
the
carpet
and
and
do
you
believe
in
god
excuse
my
i
do
repeated
raskolnikov
raising
his
eye
to
porfiry
and
do
you
believe
in
lazarus
rising
from
the
dead
i
i
do
why
do
you
ask
all
this
you
believe
it
literally
you
don
t
say
so
i
asked
from
curiosity
excuse
me
but
let
u
go
back
to
the
question
they
are
not
always
executed
some
on
the
contrary
triumph
in
their
lifetime
oh
yes
some
attain
their
end
in
this
life
and
then
they
begin
executing
other
people
if
it
s
necessary
indeed
for
the
most
part
they
do
your
remark
is
very
thank
you
but
tell
me
this
how
do
you
distinguish
those
extraordinary
people
from
the
ordinary
one
are
there
sign
at
their
birth
i
feel
there
ought
to
be
more
exactitude
more
external
definition
excuse
the
natural
anxiety
of
a
practical
citizen
but
couldn
t
they
adopt
a
special
uniform
for
instance
couldn
t
they
wear
something
be
branded
in
some
way
for
you
know
if
confusion
arises
and
a
member
of
one
category
imago
that
he
belongs
to
the
other
begin
to
eliminate
obstacle
a
you
so
happily
expressed
it
then
oh
that
very
often
happens
that
remark
is
wittier
than
the
thank
no
reason
to
but
take
note
that
the
mistake
can
only
arise
in
the
first
category
that
is
among
the
ordinary
people
a
i
perhaps
unfortunately
called
them
in
spite
of
their
predisposition
to
obedience
very
many
of
them
through
a
playfulness
of
nature
sometimes
vouchsafed
even
to
the
cow
like
to
imagine
themselves
advanced
people
destroyer
and
to
push
themselves
into
the
new
movement
and
this
quite
sincerely
meanwhile
the
really
people
are
very
often
unobserved
by
them
or
even
despised
a
reactionary
of
grovelling
tendency
but
i
don
t
think
there
is
any
considerable
danger
here
and
you
really
need
not
be
uneasy
for
they
never
go
very
far
of
course
they
might
have
a
thrashing
sometimes
for
letting
their
fancy
run
away
with
them
and
to
teach
them
their
place
but
no
more
in
fact
even
this
isn
t
necessary
a
they
castigate
themselves
for
they
are
very
conscientious
some
perform
this
service
for
one
another
and
others
chastise
themselves
with
their
own
hand
they
will
impose
various
public
act
of
penitence
upon
themselves
with
a
beautiful
and
edifying
effect
in
fact
you
ve
nothing
to
be
uneasy
about
it
s
a
law
of
well
you
have
certainly
set
my
mind
more
at
rest
on
that
score
but
there
s
another
thing
worry
me
tell
me
please
are
there
many
people
who
have
the
right
to
kill
others
these
extraordinary
people
i
am
ready
to
bow
down
to
them
of
course
but
you
must
admit
it
s
alarming
if
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
eh
oh
you
needn
t
worry
about
that
either
raskolnikov
went
on
in
the
same
tone
people
with
new
idea
people
with
the
faintest
capacity
for
saying
something
are
extremely
few
in
number
extraordinarily
so
in
fact
one
thing
only
is
clear
that
the
appearance
of
all
these
grade
and
of
men
must
follow
with
unfailing
regularity
some
law
of
nature
that
law
of
course
is
unknown
at
present
but
i
am
convinced
that
it
exists
and
one
day
may
become
known
the
vast
mass
of
mankind
is
mere
material
and
only
exists
in
order
by
some
great
effort
by
some
mysterious
process
by
mean
of
some
crossing
of
race
and
stock
to
bring
into
the
world
at
last
perhaps
one
man
out
of
a
thousand
with
a
spark
of
independence
one
in
ten
thousand
perhaps
i
speak
roughly
approximately
is
born
with
some
independence
and
with
still
greater
independence
one
in
a
hundred
thousand
the
man
of
genius
is
one
of
million
and
the
great
genius
the
crown
of
humanity
appear
on
earth
perhaps
one
in
many
thousand
million
in
fact
i
have
not
peeped
into
the
retort
in
which
all
this
take
place
but
there
certainly
is
and
must
be
a
definite
law
it
can
not
be
a
matter
of
why
are
you
both
joking
razumihin
cried
at
last
there
you
sit
making
fun
of
one
another
are
you
serious
rodya
raskolnikov
raised
his
pale
and
almost
mournful
face
and
made
no
reply
and
the
unconcealed
persistent
nervous
and
sarcasm
of
porfiry
seemed
strange
to
razumihin
beside
that
quiet
and
mournful
face
well
brother
if
you
are
really
serious
you
are
right
of
course
in
saying
that
it
s
not
new
that
it
s
like
what
we
ve
read
and
heard
a
thousand
time
already
but
what
is
really
original
in
all
this
and
is
exclusively
your
own
to
my
horror
is
that
you
sanction
bloodshed
the
name
of
and
excuse
my
saying
so
with
such
fanaticism
that
i
take
it
is
the
point
of
your
article
but
that
sanction
of
bloodshed
is
to
my
mind
more
terrible
than
the
official
legal
sanction
of
bloodshed
you
are
quite
right
it
is
more
terrible
porfiry
agreed
yes
you
must
have
exaggerated
there
is
some
mistake
i
shall
read
it
you
can
t
think
that
i
shall
read
all
that
is
not
in
the
article
there
s
only
a
hint
of
it
said
raskolnikov
yes
porfiry
couldn
t
sit
still
your
attitude
to
crime
is
pretty
clear
to
me
now
but
excuse
me
for
my
impertinence
i
am
really
ashamed
to
be
worrying
you
like
this
you
see
you
ve
removed
my
anxiety
a
to
the
two
grade
getting
mixed
but
there
are
various
practical
possibility
that
make
me
uneasy
what
if
some
man
or
youth
imago
that
he
is
a
lycurgus
or
mahomet
a
future
one
of
course
and
suppose
he
begin
to
remove
all
obstacle
he
ha
some
great
enterprise
before
him
and
need
money
for
it
and
try
to
get
it
do
you
see
zametov
gave
a
sudden
guffaw
in
his
corner
raskolnikov
did
not
even
raise
his
eye
to
him
i
must
admit
he
went
on
calmly
that
such
case
certainly
must
arise
the
vain
and
foolish
are
particularly
apt
to
fall
into
that
snare
young
people
yes
you
see
well
then
what
then
raskolnikov
smiled
in
reply
that
s
not
my
fault
so
it
is
and
so
it
always
will
be
he
said
just
now
he
nodded
at
razumihin
that
i
sanction
bloodshed
society
is
too
well
protected
by
prison
banishment
criminal
investigator
penal
servitude
there
s
no
need
to
be
uneasy
you
have
but
to
catch
the
and
what
if
we
do
catch
him
then
he
get
what
he
you
are
certainly
logical
but
what
of
his
conscience
why
do
you
care
about
that
simply
from
if
he
ha
a
conscience
he
will
suffer
for
his
mistake
that
will
be
his
punishment
a
well
a
the
but
the
real
genius
asked
razumihin
frowning
those
who
have
the
right
to
murder
oughtn
t
they
to
suffer
at
all
even
for
the
blood
they
ve
shed
why
the
word
it
s
not
a
matter
of
permission
or
prohibition
he
will
suffer
if
he
is
sorry
for
his
victim
pain
and
suffering
are
always
inevitable
for
a
large
intelligence
and
a
deep
heart
the
really
great
men
must
i
think
have
great
sadness
on
earth
he
added
dreamily
not
in
the
tone
of
the
conversation
he
raised
his
eye
looked
earnestly
at
them
all
smiled
and
took
his
cap
he
wa
too
quiet
by
comparison
with
his
manner
at
his
entrance
and
he
felt
this
everyone
got
up
well
you
may
abuse
me
be
angry
with
me
if
you
like
porfiry
petrovitch
began
again
but
i
can
t
resist
allow
me
one
little
question
i
know
i
am
troubling
you
there
is
just
one
little
notion
i
want
to
express
simply
that
i
may
not
forget
very
good
tell
me
your
little
notion
raskolnikov
stood
waiting
pale
and
grave
before
him
well
you
see
i
really
don
t
know
how
to
express
it
properly
it
s
a
playful
psychological
idea
when
you
were
writing
your
article
surely
you
couldn
t
have
helped
fancying
yourself
just
a
little
an
extraordinary
man
uttering
a
in
your
sense
that
s
so
isn
t
it
quite
possibly
raskolnikov
answered
contemptuously
razumihin
made
a
movement
and
if
so
could
you
bring
yourself
in
case
of
worldly
difficulty
and
hardship
or
for
some
service
to
humanity
to
overstep
obstacle
for
instance
to
rob
and
murder
and
again
he
winked
with
his
left
eye
and
laughed
noiselessly
just
a
before
if
i
did
i
certainly
should
not
tell
you
raskolnikov
answered
with
defiant
and
haughty
contempt
no
i
wa
only
interested
on
account
of
your
article
from
a
literary
point
of
view
foo
how
obvious
and
insolent
that
is
raskolnikov
thought
with
repulsion
allow
me
to
observe
he
answered
dryly
that
i
don
t
consider
myself
a
mahomet
or
a
napoleon
nor
any
personage
of
that
kind
and
not
being
one
of
them
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
should
oh
come
don
t
we
all
think
ourselves
napoleon
now
in
russia
porfiry
petrovitch
said
with
alarming
familiarity
something
peculiar
betrayed
itself
in
the
very
intonation
of
his
voice
perhaps
it
wa
one
of
these
future
napoleon
who
did
for
alyona
ivanovna
last
week
zametov
blurted
out
from
the
corner
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
but
looked
firmly
and
intently
at
porfiry
razumihin
wa
scowling
gloomily
he
seemed
before
this
to
be
noticing
something
he
looked
angrily
around
there
wa
a
minute
of
gloomy
silence
raskolnikov
turned
to
go
are
you
going
already
porfiry
said
amiably
holding
out
his
hand
with
excessive
politeness
very
very
glad
of
your
acquaintance
a
for
your
request
have
no
uneasiness
write
just
a
i
told
you
or
better
still
come
to
me
there
yourself
in
a
day
or
two
indeed
i
shall
be
there
at
eleven
o
clock
for
certain
we
ll
arrange
it
all
we
ll
have
a
talk
a
one
of
the
last
to
be
you
might
perhaps
be
able
to
tell
u
something
he
added
with
a
most
expression
you
want
to
me
officially
in
due
form
raskolnikov
asked
sharply
oh
why
that
s
not
necessary
for
the
present
you
misunderstand
me
i
lose
no
opportunity
you
see
and
i
ve
talked
with
all
who
had
pledge
i
obtained
evidence
from
some
of
them
and
you
are
the
last
yes
by
the
way
he
cried
seemingly
suddenly
delighted
i
just
remember
what
wa
i
thinking
of
he
turned
to
razumihin
you
were
talking
my
ear
off
about
that
nikolay
of
course
i
know
i
know
very
well
he
turned
to
raskolnikov
that
the
fellow
is
innocent
but
what
is
one
to
do
we
had
to
trouble
dmitri
too
this
is
the
point
this
is
all
when
you
went
up
the
stair
it
wa
past
seven
wasn
t
it
yes
answered
raskolnikov
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
at
the
very
moment
he
spoke
that
he
need
not
have
said
it
then
when
you
went
upstairs
between
seven
and
eight
didn
t
you
see
in
a
flat
that
stood
open
on
a
second
storey
do
you
remember
two
workman
or
at
least
one
of
them
they
were
painting
there
didn
t
you
notice
them
it
s
very
very
important
for
painter
no
i
didn
t
see
them
raskolnikov
answered
slowly
a
though
ransacking
his
memory
while
at
the
same
instant
he
wa
racking
every
nerve
almost
swooning
with
anxiety
to
conjecture
a
quickly
a
possible
where
the
trap
lay
and
not
to
overlook
anything
no
i
didn
t
see
them
and
i
don
t
think
i
noticed
a
flat
like
that
open
but
on
the
fourth
storey
he
had
mastered
the
trap
now
and
wa
triumphant
i
remember
now
that
someone
wa
moving
out
of
the
flat
opposite
alyona
ivanovna
s
i
remember
i
remember
it
clearly
some
porter
were
carrying
out
a
sofa
and
they
squeezed
me
against
the
wall
but
painter
no
i
don
t
remember
that
there
were
any
painter
and
i
don
t
think
that
there
wa
a
flat
open
anywhere
no
there
wasn
what
do
you
mean
razumihin
shouted
suddenly
a
though
he
had
reflected
and
realised
why
it
wa
on
the
day
of
the
murder
the
painter
were
at
work
and
he
wa
there
three
day
before
what
are
you
asking
foo
i
have
muddled
it
porfiry
slapped
himself
on
the
forehead
deuce
take
it
this
business
is
turning
my
brain
he
addressed
raskolnikov
somewhat
apologetically
it
would
be
such
a
great
thing
for
u
to
find
out
whether
anyone
had
seen
them
between
seven
and
eight
at
the
flat
so
i
fancied
you
could
perhaps
have
told
u
something
i
quite
muddled
then
you
should
be
more
careful
razumihin
observed
grimly
the
last
word
were
uttered
in
the
passage
porfiry
petrovitch
saw
them
to
the
door
with
excessive
politeness
they
went
out
into
the
street
gloomy
and
sullen
and
for
some
step
they
did
not
say
a
word
raskolnikov
drew
a
deep
breath
chapter
vi
i
don
t
believe
it
i
can
t
believe
it
repeated
razumihin
trying
in
perplexity
to
refute
raskolnikov
s
argument
they
were
by
now
approaching
bakaleyev
s
lodging
where
pulcheria
alexandrovna
and
dounia
had
been
expecting
them
a
long
while
razumihin
kept
stopping
on
the
way
in
the
heat
of
discussion
confused
and
excited
by
the
very
fact
that
they
were
for
the
first
time
speaking
openly
about
don
t
believe
it
then
answered
raskolnikov
with
a
cold
careless
smile
you
were
noticing
nothing
a
usual
but
i
wa
weighing
every
you
are
suspicious
that
is
why
you
weighed
their
word
h
m
certainly
i
agree
porfiry
s
tone
wa
rather
strange
and
still
more
that
wretch
zametov
you
are
right
there
wa
something
about
him
but
why
why
he
ha
changed
his
mind
since
last
quite
the
contrary
if
they
had
that
brainless
idea
they
would
do
their
utmost
to
hide
it
and
conceal
their
card
so
a
to
catch
you
afterwards
but
it
wa
all
impudent
and
if
they
had
had
fact
i
mean
real
fact
or
at
least
ground
for
suspicion
then
they
would
certainly
have
tried
to
hide
their
game
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
they
would
have
made
a
search
long
ago
besides
but
they
have
no
fact
not
one
it
is
all
mirage
all
ambiguous
simply
a
floating
idea
so
they
try
to
throw
me
out
by
impudence
and
perhaps
he
wa
irritated
at
having
no
fact
and
blurted
it
out
in
his
vexation
or
perhaps
he
ha
some
plan
he
seems
an
intelligent
man
perhaps
he
wanted
to
frighten
me
by
pretending
to
know
they
have
a
psychology
of
their
own
brother
but
it
is
loathsome
explaining
it
all
stop
and
it
s
insulting
insulting
i
understand
you
but
since
we
have
spoken
openly
now
and
it
is
an
excellent
thing
that
we
have
at
last
i
am
glad
i
will
own
now
frankly
that
i
noticed
it
in
them
long
ago
this
idea
of
course
the
merest
hint
only
an
insinuation
but
why
an
insinuation
even
how
dare
they
what
foundation
have
they
if
only
you
knew
how
furious
i
have
been
think
only
simply
because
a
poor
student
unhinged
by
poverty
and
hypochondria
on
the
eve
of
a
severe
delirious
illness
note
that
suspicious
vain
proud
who
ha
not
seen
a
soul
to
speak
to
for
six
month
in
rag
and
in
boot
without
sol
ha
to
face
some
wretched
policeman
and
put
up
with
their
insolence
and
the
unexpected
debt
thrust
under
his
nose
the
presented
by
tchebarov
the
new
paint
thirty
degree
reaumur
and
a
stifling
atmosphere
a
crowd
of
people
the
talk
about
the
murder
of
a
person
where
he
had
been
just
before
and
all
that
on
an
empty
stomach
he
might
well
have
a
fainting
fit
and
that
that
is
what
they
found
it
all
on
damn
them
i
understand
how
annoying
it
is
but
in
your
place
rodya
i
would
laugh
at
them
or
better
still
spit
in
their
ugly
face
and
spit
a
dozen
time
in
all
direction
i
d
hit
out
in
all
direction
neatly
too
and
so
i
d
put
an
end
to
it
damn
them
don
t
be
downhearted
it
s
a
shame
he
really
ha
put
it
well
though
raskolnikov
thought
damn
them
but
the
again
he
said
with
bitterness
must
i
really
enter
into
explanation
with
them
i
feel
vexed
a
it
is
that
i
condescended
to
speak
to
zametov
yesterday
in
the
restaurant
damn
it
i
will
go
myself
to
porfiry
i
will
squeeze
it
out
of
him
a
one
of
the
family
he
must
let
me
know
the
in
and
out
of
it
all
and
a
for
zametov
at
last
he
see
through
him
thought
raskolnikov
stay
cried
razumihin
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
again
stay
you
were
wrong
i
have
thought
it
out
you
are
wrong
how
wa
that
a
trap
you
say
that
the
question
about
the
workman
wa
a
trap
but
if
you
had
done
could
you
have
said
you
had
seen
them
painting
the
flat
and
the
workman
on
the
contrary
you
would
have
seen
nothing
even
if
you
had
seen
it
who
would
own
it
against
himself
if
i
had
done
i
should
certainly
have
said
that
i
had
seen
the
workman
and
the
flat
raskolnikov
answered
with
reluctance
and
obvious
disgust
but
why
speak
against
yourself
because
only
peasant
or
the
most
inexperienced
novice
deny
everything
flatly
at
examination
if
a
man
is
ever
so
little
developed
and
experienced
he
will
certainly
try
to
admit
all
the
external
fact
that
can
t
be
avoided
but
will
seek
other
explanation
of
them
will
introduce
some
special
unexpected
turn
that
will
give
them
another
significance
and
put
them
in
another
light
porfiry
might
well
reckon
that
i
should
be
sure
to
answer
so
and
say
i
had
seen
them
to
give
an
air
of
truth
and
then
make
some
but
he
would
have
told
you
at
once
that
the
workman
could
not
have
been
there
two
day
before
and
that
therefore
you
must
have
been
there
on
the
day
of
the
murder
at
eight
o
clock
and
so
he
would
have
caught
you
over
a
yes
that
is
what
he
wa
reckoning
on
that
i
should
not
have
time
to
reflect
and
should
be
in
a
hurry
to
make
the
most
likely
answer
and
so
would
forget
that
the
workman
could
not
have
been
there
two
day
but
how
could
you
forget
it
nothing
easier
it
is
in
just
such
stupid
thing
clever
people
are
most
easily
caught
the
more
cunning
a
man
is
the
less
he
suspect
that
he
will
be
caught
in
a
simple
thing
the
more
cunning
a
man
is
the
simpler
the
trap
he
must
be
caught
in
porfiry
is
not
such
a
fool
a
you
think
he
is
a
knave
then
if
that
is
so
raskolnikov
could
not
help
laughing
but
at
the
very
moment
he
wa
struck
by
the
strangeness
of
his
own
frankness
and
the
eagerness
with
which
he
had
made
this
explanation
though
he
had
kept
up
all
the
preceding
conversation
with
gloomy
repulsion
obviously
with
a
motive
from
necessity
i
am
getting
a
relish
for
certain
aspect
he
thought
to
himself
but
almost
at
the
same
instant
he
became
suddenly
uneasy
a
though
an
unexpected
and
alarming
idea
had
occurred
to
him
his
uneasiness
kept
on
increasing
they
had
just
reached
the
entrance
to
bakaleyev
s
go
in
alone
said
raskolnikov
suddenly
i
will
be
back
where
are
you
going
why
we
are
just
i
can
t
help
it
i
will
come
in
half
an
hour
tell
say
what
you
like
i
will
come
with
you
too
want
to
torture
me
he
screamed
with
such
bitter
irritation
such
despair
in
his
eye
that
razumihin
s
hand
dropped
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
step
looking
gloomily
at
raskolnikov
striding
rapidly
away
in
the
direction
of
his
lodging
at
last
gritting
his
teeth
and
clenching
his
fist
he
swore
he
would
squeeze
porfiry
like
a
lemon
that
very
day
and
went
up
the
stair
to
reassure
pulcheria
alexandrovna
who
wa
by
now
alarmed
at
their
long
absence
when
raskolnikov
got
home
his
hair
wa
soaked
with
sweat
and
he
wa
breathing
heavily
he
went
rapidly
up
the
stair
walked
into
his
unlocked
room
and
at
once
fastened
the
latch
then
in
senseless
terror
he
rushed
to
the
corner
to
that
hole
under
the
paper
where
he
had
put
the
thing
put
his
hand
in
and
for
some
minute
felt
carefully
in
the
hole
in
every
crack
and
fold
of
the
paper
finding
nothing
he
got
up
and
drew
a
deep
breath
a
he
wa
reaching
the
step
of
bakaleyev
s
he
suddenly
fancied
that
something
a
chain
a
stud
or
even
a
bit
of
paper
in
which
they
had
been
wrapped
with
the
old
woman
s
handwriting
on
it
might
somehow
have
slipped
out
and
been
lost
in
some
crack
and
then
might
suddenly
turn
up
a
unexpected
conclusive
evidence
against
him
he
stood
a
though
lost
in
thought
and
a
strange
humiliated
half
senseless
smile
strayed
on
his
lip
he
took
his
cap
at
last
and
went
quietly
out
of
the
room
his
idea
were
all
tangled
he
went
dreamily
through
the
gateway
here
he
is
himself
shouted
a
loud
voice
he
raised
his
head
the
porter
wa
standing
at
the
door
of
his
little
room
and
wa
pointing
him
out
to
a
short
man
who
looked
like
an
artisan
wearing
a
long
coat
and
a
waistcoat
and
looking
at
a
distance
remarkably
like
a
woman
he
stooped
and
his
head
in
a
greasy
cap
hung
forward
from
his
wrinkled
flabby
face
he
looked
over
fifty
his
little
eye
were
lost
in
fat
and
they
looked
out
grimly
sternly
and
discontentedly
what
is
it
raskolnikov
asked
going
up
to
the
porter
the
man
stole
a
look
at
him
from
under
his
brow
and
he
looked
at
him
attentively
deliberately
then
he
turned
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
gate
into
the
street
without
saying
a
word
what
is
it
cried
raskolnikov
why
he
there
wa
asking
whether
a
student
lived
here
mentioned
your
name
and
whom
you
lodged
with
i
saw
you
coming
and
pointed
you
out
and
he
went
away
it
s
the
porter
too
seemed
rather
puzzled
but
not
much
so
and
after
wondering
for
a
moment
he
turned
and
went
back
to
his
room
raskolnikov
ran
after
the
stranger
and
at
once
caught
sight
of
him
walking
along
the
other
side
of
the
street
with
the
same
even
deliberate
step
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
ground
a
though
in
meditation
he
soon
overtook
him
but
for
some
time
walked
behind
him
at
last
moving
on
to
a
level
with
him
he
looked
at
his
face
the
man
noticed
him
at
once
looked
at
him
quickly
but
dropped
his
eye
again
and
so
they
walked
for
a
minute
side
by
side
without
uttering
a
word
you
were
inquiring
for
me
of
the
porter
raskolnikov
said
at
last
but
in
a
curiously
quiet
voice
the
man
made
no
answer
he
didn
t
even
look
at
him
again
they
were
both
silent
why
do
you
come
and
ask
for
me
and
say
nothing
what
s
the
meaning
of
it
raskolnikov
s
voice
broke
and
he
seemed
unable
to
articulate
the
word
clearly
the
man
raised
his
eye
this
time
and
turned
a
gloomy
sinister
look
at
raskolnikov
murderer
he
said
suddenly
in
a
quiet
but
clear
and
distinct
voice
raskolnikov
went
on
walking
beside
him
his
leg
felt
suddenly
weak
a
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine
and
his
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
began
throbbing
a
though
it
were
set
free
so
they
walked
for
about
a
hundred
pace
side
by
side
in
silence
the
man
did
not
look
at
him
what
do
you
mean
what
is
who
is
a
murderer
muttered
raskolnikov
hardly
audibly
are
a
murderer
the
man
answered
still
more
articulately
and
emphatically
with
a
smile
of
triumphant
hatred
and
again
he
looked
straight
into
raskolnikov
s
pale
face
and
stricken
eye
they
had
just
reached
the
the
man
turned
to
the
left
without
looking
behind
him
raskolnikov
remained
standing
gazing
after
him
he
saw
him
turn
round
fifty
pace
away
and
look
back
at
him
still
standing
there
raskolnikov
could
not
see
clearly
but
he
fancied
that
he
wa
again
smiling
the
same
smile
of
cold
hatred
and
triumph
with
slow
faltering
step
with
shaking
knee
raskolnikov
made
his
way
back
to
his
little
garret
feeling
chilled
all
over
he
took
off
his
cap
and
put
it
on
the
table
and
for
ten
minute
he
stood
without
moving
then
he
sank
exhausted
on
the
sofa
and
with
a
weak
moan
of
pain
he
stretched
himself
on
it
so
he
lay
for
half
an
hour
he
thought
of
nothing
some
thought
or
fragment
of
thought
some
image
without
order
or
coherence
floated
before
his
mind
face
of
people
he
had
seen
in
his
childhood
or
met
somewhere
once
whom
he
would
never
have
recalled
the
belfry
of
the
church
at
the
billiard
table
in
a
restaurant
and
some
officer
playing
billiards
the
smell
of
cigar
in
some
underground
tobacco
shop
a
tavern
room
a
back
staircase
quite
dark
all
sloppy
with
dirty
water
and
strewn
with
and
the
sunday
bell
floating
in
from
somewhere
the
image
followed
one
another
whirling
like
a
hurricane
some
of
them
he
liked
and
tried
to
clutch
at
but
they
faded
and
all
the
while
there
wa
an
oppression
within
him
but
it
wa
not
overwhelming
sometimes
it
wa
even
pleasant
the
slight
shivering
still
persisted
but
that
too
wa
an
almost
pleasant
sensation
he
heard
the
hurried
footstep
of
razumihin
he
closed
his
eye
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
razumihin
opened
the
door
and
stood
for
some
time
in
the
doorway
a
though
hesitating
then
he
stepped
softly
into
the
room
and
went
cautiously
to
the
sofa
raskolnikov
heard
nastasya
s
whisper
don
t
disturb
him
let
him
sleep
he
can
have
his
dinner
quite
so
answered
razumihin
both
withdrew
carefully
and
closed
the
door
another
passed
raskolnikov
opened
his
eye
turned
on
his
back
again
clasping
his
hand
behind
his
head
who
is
he
who
is
that
man
who
sprang
out
of
the
earth
where
wa
he
what
did
he
see
he
ha
seen
it
all
that
s
clear
where
wa
he
then
and
from
where
did
he
see
why
ha
he
only
now
sprung
out
of
the
earth
and
how
could
he
see
is
it
possible
hm
continued
raskolnikov
turning
cold
and
shivering
and
the
jewel
case
nikolay
found
behind
the
door
wa
that
possible
a
clue
you
miss
an
infinitesimal
line
and
you
can
build
it
into
a
pyramid
of
evidence
a
fly
flew
by
and
saw
it
is
it
possible
he
felt
with
sudden
loathing
how
weak
how
physically
weak
he
had
become
i
ought
to
have
known
it
he
thought
with
a
bitter
smile
and
how
dared
i
knowing
myself
knowing
how
i
should
be
take
up
an
axe
and
shed
blood
i
ought
to
have
known
beforehand
ah
but
i
did
know
he
whispered
in
despair
at
time
he
came
to
a
standstill
at
some
thought
no
those
men
are
not
made
so
the
real
to
whom
all
is
permitted
storm
toulon
make
a
massacre
in
paris
an
army
in
egypt
half
a
million
men
in
the
moscow
expedition
and
get
off
with
a
jest
at
vilna
and
altar
are
set
up
to
him
after
his
death
and
so
is
permitted
no
such
people
it
seems
are
not
of
flesh
but
of
bronze
one
sudden
irrelevant
idea
almost
made
him
laugh
napoleon
the
pyramid
waterloo
and
a
wretched
skinny
old
woman
a
pawnbroker
with
a
red
trunk
under
her
bed
it
s
a
nice
hash
for
porfiry
petrovitch
to
digest
how
can
they
digest
it
it
s
too
inartistic
a
napoleon
creep
under
an
old
woman
s
bed
ugh
how
loathsome
at
moment
he
felt
he
wa
raving
he
sank
into
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
the
old
woman
is
of
no
consequence
he
thought
hotly
and
incoherently
the
old
woman
wa
a
mistake
perhaps
but
she
is
not
what
matter
the
old
woman
wa
only
an
illness
i
wa
in
a
hurry
to
overstep
i
didn
t
kill
a
human
being
but
a
principle
i
killed
the
principle
but
i
didn
t
overstep
i
stopped
on
this
side
i
wa
only
capable
of
killing
and
it
seems
i
wasn
t
even
capable
of
that
principle
why
wa
that
fool
razumihin
abusing
the
socialist
they
are
industrious
commercial
people
the
happiness
of
all
is
their
case
no
life
is
only
given
to
me
once
and
i
shall
never
have
it
again
i
don
t
want
to
wait
for
the
happiness
of
i
want
to
live
myself
or
else
better
not
live
at
all
i
simply
couldn
t
pas
by
my
mother
starving
keeping
my
rouble
in
my
pocket
while
i
waited
for
the
happiness
of
i
am
putting
my
little
brick
into
the
happiness
of
all
and
so
my
heart
is
at
peace
why
have
you
let
me
slip
i
only
live
once
i
too
want
ech
i
am
an
æsthetic
louse
and
nothing
more
he
added
suddenly
laughing
like
a
madman
yes
i
am
certainly
a
louse
he
went
on
clutching
at
the
idea
gloating
over
it
and
playing
with
it
with
vindictive
pleasure
in
the
first
place
because
i
can
reason
that
i
am
one
and
secondly
because
for
a
month
past
i
have
been
troubling
benevolent
providence
calling
it
to
witness
that
not
for
my
own
fleshly
lust
did
i
undertake
it
but
with
a
grand
and
noble
object
thirdly
because
i
aimed
at
carrying
it
out
a
justly
a
possible
weighing
measuring
and
calculating
of
all
the
louse
i
picked
out
the
most
useless
one
and
proposed
to
take
from
her
only
a
much
a
i
needed
for
the
first
step
no
more
nor
less
so
the
rest
would
have
gone
to
a
monastery
according
to
her
will
and
what
show
that
i
am
utterly
a
louse
he
added
grinding
his
teeth
is
that
i
am
perhaps
viler
and
more
loathsome
than
the
louse
i
killed
and
felt
that
i
should
tell
myself
so
killing
her
can
anything
be
compared
with
the
horror
of
that
the
vulgarity
the
abjectness
i
understand
the
prophet
with
his
sabre
on
his
steed
allah
command
and
trembling
creation
must
obey
the
prophet
is
right
he
is
right
when
he
set
a
battery
across
the
street
and
blow
up
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
without
deigning
to
explain
it
s
for
you
to
obey
trembling
creation
and
not
have
for
that
s
not
for
you
i
shall
never
never
forgive
the
old
woman
his
hair
wa
soaked
with
sweat
his
quivering
lip
were
parched
his
eye
were
fixed
on
the
ceiling
mother
sister
how
i
loved
them
why
do
i
hate
them
now
yes
i
hate
them
i
feel
a
physical
hatred
for
them
i
can
t
bear
them
near
me
i
went
up
to
my
mother
and
kissed
her
i
remember
to
embrace
her
and
think
if
she
only
knew
shall
i
tell
her
then
that
s
just
what
i
might
do
must
be
the
same
a
i
am
he
added
straining
himself
to
think
a
it
were
struggling
with
delirium
ah
how
i
hate
the
old
woman
now
i
feel
i
should
kill
her
again
if
she
came
to
life
poor
lizaveta
why
did
she
come
in
it
s
strange
though
why
is
it
i
scarcely
ever
think
of
her
a
though
i
hadn
t
killed
her
lizaveta
sonia
poor
gentle
thing
with
gentle
eye
dear
woman
why
don
t
they
weep
why
don
t
they
moan
they
give
up
everything
their
eye
are
soft
and
gentle
sonia
sonia
gentle
sonia
he
lost
consciousness
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
didn
t
remember
how
he
got
into
the
street
it
wa
late
evening
the
twilight
had
fallen
and
the
full
moon
wa
shining
more
and
more
brightly
but
there
wa
a
peculiar
breathlessness
in
the
air
there
were
crowd
of
people
in
the
street
workman
and
business
people
were
making
their
way
home
other
people
had
come
out
for
a
walk
there
wa
a
smell
of
mortar
dust
and
stagnant
water
raskolnikov
walked
along
mournful
and
anxious
he
wa
distinctly
aware
of
having
come
out
with
a
purpose
of
having
to
do
something
in
a
hurry
but
what
it
wa
he
had
forgotten
suddenly
he
stood
still
and
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
beckoning
to
him
he
crossed
over
to
him
but
at
once
the
man
turned
and
walked
away
with
his
head
hanging
a
though
he
had
made
no
sign
to
him
stay
did
he
really
beckon
raskolnikov
wondered
but
he
tried
to
overtake
him
when
he
wa
within
ten
pace
he
recognised
him
and
wa
frightened
it
wa
the
same
man
with
stooping
shoulder
in
the
long
coat
raskolnikov
followed
him
at
a
distance
his
heart
wa
beating
they
went
down
a
turning
the
man
still
did
not
look
round
doe
he
know
i
am
following
him
thought
raskolnikov
the
man
went
into
the
gateway
of
a
big
house
raskolnikov
hastened
to
the
gate
and
looked
in
to
see
whether
he
would
look
round
and
sign
to
him
in
the
the
man
did
turn
round
and
again
seemed
to
beckon
him
raskolnikov
at
once
followed
him
into
the
yard
but
the
man
wa
gone
he
must
have
gone
up
the
first
staircase
raskolnikov
rushed
after
him
he
heard
slow
measured
step
two
flight
above
the
staircase
seemed
strangely
familiar
he
reached
the
window
on
the
first
floor
the
moon
shone
through
the
pane
with
a
melancholy
and
mysterious
light
then
he
reached
the
second
floor
bah
this
is
the
flat
where
the
painter
were
at
work
but
how
wa
it
he
did
not
recognise
it
at
once
the
step
of
the
man
above
had
died
away
so
he
must
have
stopped
or
hidden
he
reached
the
third
storey
should
he
go
on
there
wa
a
stillness
that
wa
dreadful
but
he
went
on
the
sound
of
his
own
footstep
scared
and
frightened
him
how
dark
it
wa
the
man
must
be
hiding
in
some
corner
here
ah
the
flat
wa
standing
wide
open
he
hesitated
and
went
in
it
wa
very
dark
and
empty
in
the
passage
a
though
everything
had
been
removed
he
crept
on
tiptoe
into
the
parlour
which
wa
flooded
with
moonlight
everything
there
wa
a
before
the
chair
the
the
yellow
sofa
and
the
picture
in
the
frame
a
huge
round
moon
looked
in
at
the
window
it
s
the
moon
that
make
it
so
still
weaving
some
mystery
thought
raskolnikov
he
stood
and
waited
waited
a
long
while
and
the
more
silent
the
moonlight
the
more
violently
his
heart
beat
till
it
wa
painful
and
still
the
same
hush
suddenly
he
heard
a
momentary
sharp
crack
like
the
snapping
of
a
splinter
and
all
wa
still
again
a
fly
flew
up
suddenly
and
struck
the
window
pane
with
a
plaintive
buzz
at
that
moment
he
noticed
in
the
corner
between
the
window
and
the
little
cupboard
something
like
a
cloak
hanging
on
the
wall
why
is
that
cloak
here
he
thought
it
wasn
t
there
before
he
went
up
to
it
quietly
and
felt
that
there
wa
someone
hiding
behind
it
he
cautiously
moved
the
cloak
and
saw
sitting
on
a
chair
in
the
corner
the
old
woman
bent
double
so
that
he
couldn
t
see
her
face
but
it
wa
she
he
stood
over
her
she
is
afraid
he
thought
he
stealthily
took
the
axe
from
the
noose
and
struck
her
one
blow
then
another
on
the
skull
but
strange
to
say
she
did
not
stir
a
though
she
were
made
of
wood
he
wa
frightened
bent
down
nearer
and
tried
to
look
at
her
but
she
too
bent
her
head
lower
he
bent
right
down
to
the
ground
and
peeped
up
into
her
face
from
below
he
peeped
and
turned
cold
with
horror
the
old
woman
wa
sitting
and
laughing
shaking
with
noiseless
laughter
doing
her
utmost
that
he
should
not
hear
it
suddenly
he
fancied
that
the
door
from
the
bedroom
wa
opened
a
little
and
that
there
wa
laughter
and
whispering
within
he
wa
overcome
with
frenzy
and
he
began
hitting
the
old
woman
on
the
head
with
all
his
force
but
at
every
blow
of
the
axe
the
laughter
and
whispering
from
the
bedroom
grew
louder
and
the
old
woman
wa
simply
shaking
with
mirth
he
wa
rushing
away
but
the
passage
wa
full
of
people
the
door
of
the
flat
stood
open
and
on
the
landing
on
the
stair
and
everywhere
below
there
were
people
row
of
head
all
looking
but
huddled
together
in
silence
and
expectation
something
gripped
his
heart
his
leg
were
rooted
to
the
spot
they
would
not
move
he
tried
to
scream
and
woke
up
he
drew
a
deep
breath
but
his
dream
seemed
strangely
to
persist
his
door
wa
flung
open
and
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
him
intently
raskolnikov
had
hardly
opened
his
eye
and
he
instantly
closed
them
again
he
lay
on
his
back
without
stirring
is
it
still
a
dream
he
wondered
and
again
raised
his
eyelid
hardly
perceptibly
the
stranger
wa
standing
in
the
same
place
still
watching
him
he
stepped
cautiously
into
the
room
carefully
closing
the
door
after
him
went
up
to
the
table
paused
a
moment
still
keeping
his
eye
on
raskolnikov
and
noiselessly
seated
himself
on
the
chair
by
the
sofa
he
put
his
hat
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
leaned
his
hand
on
his
cane
and
his
chin
on
his
hand
it
wa
evident
that
he
wa
prepared
to
wait
indefinitely
a
far
a
raskolnikov
could
make
out
from
his
stolen
glance
he
wa
a
man
no
longer
young
stout
with
a
full
fair
almost
whitish
beard
ten
minute
passed
it
wa
still
light
but
beginning
to
get
dusk
there
wa
complete
stillness
in
the
room
not
a
sound
came
from
the
stair
only
a
big
fly
buzzed
and
fluttered
against
the
window
pane
it
wa
unbearable
at
last
raskolnikov
suddenly
got
up
and
sat
on
the
sofa
come
tell
me
what
you
i
knew
you
were
not
asleep
but
only
pretending
the
stranger
answered
oddly
laughing
calmly
arkady
ivanovitch
svidrigaïlov
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
part
iv
chapter
i
can
this
be
still
a
dream
raskolnikov
thought
once
more
he
looked
carefully
and
suspiciously
at
the
unexpected
visitor
svidrigaïlov
what
nonsense
it
can
t
be
he
said
at
last
aloud
in
bewilderment
his
visitor
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
at
this
exclamation
i
ve
come
to
you
for
two
reason
in
the
first
place
i
wanted
to
make
your
personal
acquaintance
a
i
have
already
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
that
is
interesting
and
flattering
secondly
i
cherish
the
hope
that
you
may
not
refuse
to
assist
me
in
a
matter
directly
concerning
the
welfare
of
your
sister
avdotya
romanovna
for
without
your
support
she
might
not
let
me
come
near
her
now
for
she
is
prejudiced
against
me
but
with
your
assistance
i
reckon
on
you
reckon
wrongly
interrupted
raskolnikov
they
only
arrived
yesterday
may
i
ask
you
raskolnikov
made
no
reply
it
wa
yesterday
i
know
i
only
arrived
myself
the
day
before
well
let
me
tell
you
this
rodion
romanovitch
i
don
t
consider
it
necessary
to
justify
myself
but
kindly
tell
me
what
wa
there
particularly
criminal
on
my
part
in
all
this
business
speaking
without
prejudice
with
common
sense
raskolnikov
continued
to
look
at
him
in
silence
that
in
my
own
house
i
persecuted
a
defenceless
girl
and
insulted
her
with
my
infamous
proposal
is
that
it
i
am
anticipating
you
but
you
ve
only
to
assume
that
i
too
am
a
man
nihil
in
a
word
that
i
am
capable
of
being
attracted
and
falling
in
love
which
doe
not
depend
on
our
will
then
everything
can
be
explained
in
the
most
natural
manner
the
question
is
am
i
a
monster
or
am
i
myself
a
victim
and
what
if
i
am
a
victim
in
proposing
to
the
object
of
my
passion
to
elope
with
me
to
america
or
switzerland
i
may
have
cherished
the
deepest
respect
for
her
and
may
have
thought
that
i
wa
promoting
our
mutual
happiness
reason
is
the
slave
of
passion
you
know
why
probably
i
wa
doing
more
harm
to
myself
than
anyone
but
that
s
not
the
point
raskolnikov
interrupted
with
disgust
it
s
simply
that
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
we
dislike
you
we
don
t
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
we
show
you
the
door
go
out
svidrigaïlov
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
but
you
re
but
there
s
no
getting
round
you
he
said
laughing
in
the
frankest
way
i
hoped
to
get
round
you
but
you
took
up
the
right
line
at
once
but
you
are
trying
to
get
round
me
still
what
of
it
what
of
it
cried
svidrigaïlov
laughing
openly
but
this
is
what
the
french
call
and
the
most
innocent
form
of
deception
but
still
you
have
interrupted
me
one
way
or
another
i
repeat
again
there
would
never
have
been
any
unpleasantness
except
for
what
happened
in
the
garden
marfa
petrovna
you
have
got
rid
of
marfa
petrovna
too
so
they
say
raskolnikov
interrupted
rudely
oh
you
ve
heard
that
too
then
you
d
be
sure
to
though
but
a
for
your
question
i
really
don
t
know
what
to
say
though
my
own
conscience
is
quite
at
rest
on
that
score
don
t
suppose
that
i
am
in
any
apprehension
about
it
all
wa
regular
and
in
order
the
medical
inquiry
diagnosed
apoplexy
due
to
bathing
immediately
after
a
heavy
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
indeed
it
could
have
proved
nothing
else
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
have
been
thinking
to
myself
of
late
on
my
way
here
in
the
train
especially
didn
t
i
contribute
to
all
that
calamity
morally
in
a
way
by
irritation
or
something
of
the
sort
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
too
wa
quite
out
of
the
raskolnikov
laughed
i
wonder
you
trouble
yourself
about
it
but
what
are
you
laughing
at
only
consider
i
struck
her
just
twice
with
a
switch
there
were
no
mark
even
don
t
regard
me
a
a
cynic
please
i
am
perfectly
aware
how
atrocious
it
wa
of
me
and
all
that
but
i
know
for
certain
too
that
marfa
petrovna
wa
very
likely
pleased
at
my
so
to
say
warmth
the
story
of
your
sister
had
been
wrung
out
to
the
last
drop
for
the
last
three
day
marfa
petrovna
had
been
forced
to
sit
at
home
she
had
nothing
to
show
herself
with
in
the
town
besides
she
had
bored
them
so
with
that
letter
you
heard
about
her
reading
the
letter
and
all
of
a
sudden
those
two
switch
fell
from
heaven
her
first
act
wa
to
order
the
carriage
to
be
got
out
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
there
are
case
when
woman
are
very
very
glad
to
be
insulted
in
spite
of
all
their
show
of
indignation
there
are
instance
of
it
with
everyone
human
being
in
general
indeed
greatly
love
to
be
insulted
have
you
noticed
that
but
it
s
particularly
so
with
woman
one
might
even
say
it
s
their
only
at
one
time
raskolnikov
thought
of
getting
up
and
walking
out
and
so
finishing
the
interview
but
some
curiosity
and
even
a
sort
of
prudence
made
him
linger
for
a
moment
you
are
fond
of
fighting
he
asked
carelessly
no
not
very
svidrigaïlov
answered
calmly
and
marfa
petrovna
and
i
scarcely
ever
fought
we
lived
very
harmoniously
and
she
wa
always
pleased
with
me
i
only
used
the
whip
twice
in
all
our
seven
year
not
counting
a
third
occasion
of
a
very
ambiguous
character
the
first
time
two
month
after
our
marriage
immediately
after
we
arrived
in
the
country
and
the
last
time
wa
that
of
which
we
are
speaking
did
you
suppose
i
wa
such
a
monster
such
a
reactionary
such
a
slave
driver
ha
ha
by
the
way
do
you
remember
rodion
romanovitch
how
a
few
year
ago
in
those
day
of
beneficent
publicity
a
nobleman
i
ve
forgotten
his
name
wa
put
to
shame
everywhere
in
all
the
paper
for
having
thrashed
a
german
woman
in
the
railway
train
you
remember
it
wa
in
those
day
that
very
year
i
believe
the
disgraceful
action
of
the
took
place
you
know
the
egyptian
night
that
public
reading
you
remember
the
dark
eye
you
know
ah
the
golden
day
of
our
youth
where
are
they
well
a
for
the
gentleman
who
thrashed
the
german
i
feel
no
sympathy
with
him
because
after
all
what
need
is
there
for
sympathy
but
i
must
say
that
there
are
sometimes
such
provoking
german
that
i
don
t
believe
there
is
a
progressive
who
could
quite
answer
for
himself
no
one
looked
at
the
subject
from
that
point
of
view
then
but
that
s
the
truly
humane
point
of
view
i
assure
after
saying
this
svidrigaïlov
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
again
raskolnikov
saw
clearly
that
this
wa
a
man
with
a
firm
purpose
in
his
mind
and
able
to
keep
it
to
himself
i
expect
you
ve
not
talked
to
anyone
for
some
day
he
asked
scarcely
anyone
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
at
my
being
such
an
adaptable
man
no
i
am
only
wondering
at
your
being
too
adaptable
a
because
i
am
not
offended
at
the
rudeness
of
your
question
is
that
it
but
why
take
offence
a
you
asked
so
i
answered
he
replied
with
a
surprising
expression
of
simplicity
you
know
there
s
hardly
anything
i
take
interest
in
he
went
on
a
it
were
dreamily
especially
now
i
ve
nothing
to
do
you
are
quite
at
liberty
to
imagine
though
that
i
am
making
up
to
you
with
a
motive
particularly
a
i
told
you
i
want
to
see
your
sister
about
something
but
i
ll
confess
frankly
i
am
very
much
bored
the
last
three
day
especially
so
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
don
t
be
angry
rodion
romanovitch
but
you
seem
to
be
somehow
awfully
strange
yourself
say
what
you
like
there
s
something
wrong
with
you
and
now
too
not
this
very
minute
i
mean
but
now
generally
well
well
i
won
t
i
won
t
don
t
scowl
i
am
not
such
a
bear
you
know
a
you
raskolnikov
looked
gloomily
at
him
you
are
not
a
bear
perhaps
at
all
he
said
i
fancy
indeed
that
you
are
a
man
of
very
good
breeding
or
at
least
know
how
on
occasion
to
behave
like
i
am
not
particularly
interested
in
anyone
s
opinion
svidrigaïlov
answered
dryly
and
even
with
a
shade
of
haughtiness
and
therefore
why
not
be
vulgar
at
time
when
vulgarity
is
such
a
convenient
cloak
for
our
climate
and
especially
if
one
ha
a
natural
propensity
that
way
he
added
laughing
again
but
i
ve
heard
you
have
many
friend
here
you
are
a
they
say
not
without
what
can
you
want
with
me
then
unless
you
ve
some
special
object
that
s
true
that
i
have
friend
here
svidrigaïlov
admitted
not
replying
to
the
chief
point
i
ve
met
some
already
i
ve
been
lounging
about
for
the
last
three
day
and
i
ve
seen
them
or
they
ve
seen
me
that
s
a
matter
of
course
i
am
well
dressed
and
reckoned
not
a
poor
man
the
emancipation
of
the
serf
hasn
t
affected
me
my
property
consists
chiefly
of
forest
and
water
meadow
the
revenue
ha
not
fallen
off
but
i
am
not
going
to
see
them
i
wa
sick
of
them
long
ago
i
ve
been
here
three
day
and
have
called
on
no
one
what
a
town
it
is
how
ha
it
come
into
existence
among
u
tell
me
that
a
town
of
official
and
student
of
all
sort
yes
there
s
a
great
deal
i
didn
t
notice
when
i
wa
here
eight
year
ago
kicking
up
my
heel
my
only
hope
now
is
in
anatomy
by
jove
it
is
anatomy
but
a
for
these
club
dussauts
parade
or
progress
indeed
maybe
well
all
that
can
go
on
without
me
he
went
on
again
without
noticing
the
question
besides
who
want
to
be
a
why
have
you
been
a
then
how
could
i
help
being
there
wa
a
regular
set
of
u
men
of
the
best
society
eight
year
ago
we
had
a
fine
time
and
all
men
of
breeding
you
know
poet
men
of
property
and
indeed
a
a
rule
in
our
russian
society
the
best
manner
are
found
among
those
who
ve
been
thrashed
have
you
noticed
that
i
ve
deteriorated
in
the
country
but
i
did
get
into
prison
for
debt
through
a
low
greek
who
came
from
nezhin
then
marfa
petrovna
turned
up
she
bargained
with
him
and
bought
me
off
for
thirty
thousand
silver
piece
i
owed
seventy
thousand
we
were
united
in
lawful
wedlock
and
she
bore
me
off
into
the
country
like
a
treasure
you
know
she
wa
five
year
older
than
i
she
wa
very
fond
of
me
for
seven
year
i
never
left
the
country
and
take
note
that
all
my
life
she
held
a
document
over
me
the
iou
for
thirty
thousand
rouble
so
if
i
were
to
elect
to
be
restive
about
anything
i
should
be
trapped
at
once
and
she
would
have
done
it
woman
find
nothing
incompatible
in
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
would
you
have
given
her
the
slip
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
it
wa
scarcely
the
document
restrained
me
i
didn
t
want
to
go
anywhere
else
marfa
petrovna
herself
invited
me
to
go
abroad
seeing
i
wa
bored
but
i
ve
been
abroad
before
and
always
felt
sick
there
for
no
reason
but
the
sunrise
the
bay
of
naples
the
sea
you
look
at
them
and
it
make
you
sad
what
s
most
revolting
is
that
one
is
really
sad
no
it
s
better
at
home
here
at
least
one
blame
others
for
everything
and
excuse
oneself
i
should
have
gone
perhaps
on
an
expedition
to
the
north
pole
because
ai
le
vin
and
hate
drinking
and
there
s
nothing
left
but
wine
i
have
tried
it
but
i
say
i
ve
been
told
berg
is
going
up
in
a
great
balloon
next
sunday
from
the
yusupov
garden
and
will
take
up
passenger
at
a
fee
is
it
true
why
would
you
go
up
i
no
oh
no
muttered
svidrigaïlov
really
seeming
to
be
deep
in
thought
what
doe
he
mean
is
he
in
earnest
raskolnikov
wondered
no
the
document
didn
t
restrain
me
svidrigaïlov
went
on
meditatively
it
wa
my
own
doing
not
leaving
the
country
and
nearly
a
year
ago
marfa
petrovna
gave
me
back
the
document
on
my
and
made
me
a
present
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
too
she
had
a
fortune
you
know
you
see
how
i
trust
you
arkady
ivanovitch
that
wa
actually
her
expression
you
don
t
believe
she
used
it
but
do
you
know
i
managed
the
estate
quite
decently
they
know
me
in
the
neighbourhood
i
ordered
book
too
marfa
petrovna
at
first
approved
but
afterwards
she
wa
afraid
of
my
you
seem
to
be
missing
marfa
petrovna
very
much
missing
her
perhaps
really
perhaps
i
am
and
by
the
way
do
you
believe
in
ghost
what
ghost
why
ordinary
do
you
believe
in
them
perhaps
not
vous
i
wouldn
t
say
no
do
you
see
them
then
svidrigaïlov
looked
at
him
rather
oddly
marfa
petrovna
is
pleased
to
visit
me
he
said
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
strange
smile
how
do
you
mean
she
is
pleased
to
visit
you
she
ha
been
three
time
i
saw
her
first
on
the
very
day
of
the
funeral
an
hour
after
she
wa
buried
it
wa
the
day
before
i
left
to
come
here
the
second
time
wa
the
day
before
yesterday
at
daybreak
on
the
journey
at
the
station
of
malaya
vishera
and
the
third
time
wa
two
hour
ago
in
the
room
where
i
am
staying
i
wa
were
you
awake
quite
awake
i
wa
wide
awake
every
time
she
come
speaks
to
me
for
a
minute
and
go
out
at
the
door
always
at
the
door
i
can
almost
hear
what
made
me
think
that
something
of
the
sort
must
be
happening
to
you
raskolnikov
said
suddenly
at
the
same
moment
he
wa
surprised
at
having
said
it
he
wa
much
excited
what
did
you
think
so
svidrigaïlov
asked
in
astonishment
did
you
really
didn
t
i
say
that
there
wa
something
in
common
between
u
eh
you
never
said
so
raskolnikov
cried
sharply
and
with
heat
didn
t
i
no
i
thought
i
did
when
i
came
in
and
saw
you
lying
with
your
eye
shut
pretending
i
said
to
myself
at
once
here
s
the
what
do
you
mean
by
the
man
what
are
you
talking
about
cried
raskolnikov
what
do
i
mean
i
really
don
t
know
svidrigaïlov
muttered
ingenuously
a
though
he
too
were
puzzled
for
a
minute
they
were
silent
they
stared
in
each
other
s
face
that
s
all
nonsense
raskolnikov
shouted
with
vexation
what
doe
she
say
when
she
come
to
you
she
would
you
believe
it
she
talk
of
the
silliest
trifle
and
man
is
a
strange
creature
it
make
me
angry
the
first
time
she
came
in
i
wa
tired
you
know
the
funeral
service
the
funeral
ceremony
the
lunch
afterwards
at
last
i
wa
left
alone
in
my
study
i
lighted
a
cigar
and
began
to
think
she
came
in
at
the
door
you
ve
been
so
busy
arkady
ivanovitch
you
have
forgotten
to
wind
the
clock
she
said
all
those
seven
year
i
ve
wound
that
clock
every
week
and
if
i
forgot
it
she
would
always
remind
me
the
next
day
i
set
off
on
my
way
here
i
got
out
at
the
station
at
daybreak
i
d
been
asleep
tired
out
with
my
eye
half
open
i
wa
drinking
some
coffee
i
looked
up
and
there
wa
suddenly
marfa
petrovna
sitting
beside
me
with
a
pack
of
card
in
her
hand
shall
i
tell
your
fortune
for
the
journey
arkady
ivanovitch
she
wa
a
great
hand
at
telling
fortune
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
not
asking
her
to
i
ran
away
in
a
fright
and
besides
the
bell
rang
i
wa
sitting
feeling
very
heavy
after
a
miserable
dinner
from
a
cookshop
i
wa
sitting
smoking
all
of
a
sudden
marfa
petrovna
again
she
came
in
very
smart
in
a
new
green
silk
dress
with
a
long
train
good
day
arkady
ivanovitch
how
do
you
like
my
dress
aniska
can
t
make
like
aniska
wa
a
dressmaker
in
the
country
one
of
our
former
serf
girl
who
had
been
trained
in
moscow
a
pretty
wench
she
stood
turning
round
before
me
i
looked
at
the
dress
and
then
i
looked
carefully
very
carefully
at
her
face
i
wonder
you
trouble
to
come
to
me
about
such
trifle
marfa
good
gracious
you
won
t
let
one
disturb
you
about
anything
to
tease
her
i
said
i
want
to
get
married
marfa
that
s
just
like
you
arkady
ivanovitch
it
doe
you
very
little
credit
to
come
looking
for
a
bride
when
you
ve
hardly
buried
your
wife
and
if
you
could
make
a
good
choice
at
least
but
i
know
it
won
t
be
for
your
happiness
or
hers
you
will
only
be
a
to
all
good
then
she
went
out
and
her
train
seemed
to
rustle
isn
t
it
nonsense
eh
but
perhaps
you
are
telling
lie
raskolnikov
put
in
i
rarely
lie
answered
svidrigaïlov
thoughtfully
apparently
not
noticing
the
rudeness
of
the
question
and
in
the
past
have
you
ever
seen
ghost
before
i
have
seen
them
but
only
once
in
my
life
six
year
ago
i
had
a
serf
filka
just
after
his
burial
i
called
out
forgetting
filka
my
pipe
he
came
in
and
went
to
the
cupboard
where
my
pipe
were
i
sat
still
and
thought
he
is
doing
it
out
of
revenge
because
we
had
a
violent
quarrel
just
before
his
death
how
dare
you
come
in
with
a
hole
in
your
elbow
i
said
go
away
you
scamp
he
turned
and
went
out
and
never
came
again
i
didn
t
tell
marfa
petrovna
at
the
time
i
wanted
to
have
a
service
sung
for
him
but
i
wa
you
should
go
to
a
i
know
i
am
not
well
without
your
telling
me
though
i
don
t
know
what
s
wrong
i
believe
i
am
five
time
a
strong
a
you
are
i
didn
t
ask
you
whether
you
believe
that
ghost
are
seen
but
whether
you
believe
that
they
no
i
won
t
believe
it
raskolnikov
cried
with
positive
anger
what
do
people
generally
say
muttered
svidrigaïlov
a
though
speaking
to
himself
looking
aside
and
bowing
his
head
they
say
you
are
ill
so
what
appears
to
you
is
only
unreal
but
that
s
not
strictly
logical
i
agree
that
ghost
only
appear
to
the
sick
but
that
only
prof
that
they
are
unable
to
appear
except
to
the
sick
not
that
they
don
t
nothing
of
the
sort
raskolnikov
insisted
irritably
no
you
don
t
think
so
svidrigaïlov
went
on
looking
at
him
deliberately
but
what
do
you
say
to
this
argument
help
me
with
it
ghost
are
a
it
were
shred
and
fragment
of
other
world
the
beginning
of
them
a
man
in
health
ha
of
course
no
reason
to
see
them
because
he
is
above
all
a
man
of
this
earth
and
is
bound
for
the
sake
of
completeness
and
order
to
live
only
in
this
life
but
a
soon
a
one
is
ill
a
soon
a
the
normal
earthly
order
of
the
organism
is
broken
one
begin
to
realise
the
possibility
of
another
world
and
the
more
seriously
ill
one
is
the
closer
becomes
one
s
contact
with
that
other
world
so
that
a
soon
a
the
man
dy
he
step
straight
into
that
world
i
thought
of
that
long
ago
if
you
believe
in
a
future
life
you
could
believe
in
that
i
don
t
believe
in
a
future
life
said
raskolnikov
svidrigaïlov
sat
lost
in
thought
and
what
if
there
are
only
spider
there
or
something
of
that
sort
he
said
suddenly
he
is
a
madman
thought
raskolnikov
we
always
imagine
eternity
a
something
beyond
our
conception
something
vast
vast
but
why
must
it
be
vast
instead
of
all
that
what
if
it
s
one
little
room
like
a
bath
house
in
the
country
black
and
grimy
and
spider
in
every
corner
and
that
s
all
eternity
is
i
sometimes
fancy
it
like
can
it
be
you
can
imagine
nothing
juster
and
more
comforting
than
that
raskolnikov
cried
with
a
feeling
of
anguish
juster
and
how
can
we
tell
perhaps
that
is
just
and
do
you
know
it
s
what
i
would
certainly
have
made
it
answered
svidrigaïlov
with
a
vague
smile
this
horrible
answer
sent
a
cold
chill
through
raskolnikov
svidrigaïlov
raised
his
head
looked
at
him
and
suddenly
began
laughing
only
think
he
cried
half
an
hour
ago
we
had
never
seen
each
other
we
regarded
each
other
a
enemy
there
is
a
matter
unsettled
between
u
we
ve
thrown
it
aside
and
away
we
ve
gone
into
the
abstract
wasn
t
i
right
in
saying
that
we
were
bird
of
a
feather
kindly
allow
me
raskolnikov
went
on
irritably
to
ask
you
to
explain
why
you
have
honoured
me
with
your
visit
and
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
have
no
time
to
waste
i
want
to
go
by
all
mean
by
all
mean
your
sister
avdotya
romanovna
is
going
to
be
married
to
luzhin
pyotr
petrovitch
can
you
refrain
from
any
question
about
my
sister
and
from
mentioning
her
name
i
can
t
understand
how
you
dare
utter
her
name
in
my
presence
if
you
really
are
why
but
i
ve
come
here
to
speak
about
her
how
can
i
avoid
mentioning
her
very
good
speak
but
make
i
am
sure
that
you
must
have
formed
your
own
opinion
of
this
luzhin
who
is
a
connection
of
mine
through
my
wife
if
you
have
only
seen
him
for
half
an
hour
or
heard
any
fact
about
him
he
is
no
match
for
avdotya
romanovna
i
believe
avdotya
romanovna
is
sacrificing
herself
generously
and
imprudently
for
the
sake
of
for
the
sake
of
her
family
i
fancied
from
all
i
had
heard
of
you
that
you
would
be
very
glad
if
the
match
could
be
broken
off
without
the
sacrifice
of
worldly
advantage
now
i
know
you
personally
i
am
convinced
of
all
this
is
very
naïve
excuse
me
i
should
have
said
impudent
on
your
part
said
raskolnikov
you
mean
to
say
that
i
am
seeking
my
own
end
don
t
be
uneasy
rodion
romanovitch
if
i
were
working
for
my
own
advantage
i
would
not
have
spoken
out
so
directly
i
am
not
quite
a
fool
i
will
confess
something
psychologically
curious
about
that
just
now
defending
my
love
for
avdotya
romanovna
i
said
i
wa
myself
the
victim
well
let
me
tell
you
that
i
ve
no
feeling
of
love
now
not
the
slightest
so
that
i
wonder
myself
indeed
for
i
really
did
feel
something
through
idleness
and
depravity
raskolnikov
put
in
i
certainly
am
idle
and
depraved
but
your
sister
ha
such
quality
that
even
i
could
not
help
being
impressed
by
them
but
that
s
all
nonsense
a
i
see
myself
have
you
seen
that
long
i
began
to
be
aware
of
it
before
but
wa
only
perfectly
sure
of
it
the
day
before
yesterday
almost
at
the
moment
i
arrived
in
petersburg
i
still
fancied
in
moscow
though
that
i
wa
coming
to
try
to
get
avdotya
romanovna
s
hand
and
to
cut
out
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
kindly
be
brief
and
come
to
the
object
of
your
visit
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
want
to
go
out
with
the
greatest
pleasure
on
arriving
here
and
determining
on
a
certain
journey
i
should
like
to
make
some
necessary
preliminary
arrangement
i
left
my
child
with
an
aunt
they
are
well
provided
for
and
they
have
no
need
of
me
personally
and
a
nice
father
i
should
make
too
i
have
taken
nothing
but
what
marfa
petrovna
gave
me
a
year
ago
that
s
enough
for
me
excuse
me
i
am
just
coming
to
the
point
before
the
journey
which
may
come
off
i
want
to
settle
luzhin
too
it
s
not
that
i
detest
him
so
much
but
it
wa
through
him
i
quarrelled
with
marfa
petrovna
when
i
learned
that
she
had
dished
up
this
marriage
i
want
now
to
see
avdotya
romanovna
through
your
mediation
and
if
you
like
in
your
presence
to
explain
to
her
that
in
the
first
place
she
will
never
gain
anything
but
harm
from
luzhin
then
begging
her
pardon
for
all
past
unpleasantness
to
make
her
a
present
of
ten
thousand
rouble
and
so
assist
the
rupture
with
luzhin
a
rupture
to
which
i
believe
she
is
herself
not
disinclined
if
she
could
see
the
way
to
you
are
certainly
mad
cried
raskolnikov
not
so
much
angered
a
astonished
how
dare
you
talk
like
that
i
knew
you
would
scream
at
me
but
in
the
first
place
though
i
am
not
rich
this
ten
thousand
rouble
is
perfectly
free
i
have
absolutely
no
need
for
it
if
avdotya
romanovna
doe
not
accept
it
i
shall
waste
it
in
some
more
foolish
way
that
s
the
first
thing
secondly
my
conscience
is
perfectly
easy
i
make
the
offer
with
no
ulterior
motive
you
may
not
believe
it
but
in
the
end
avdotya
romanovna
and
you
will
know
the
point
is
that
i
did
actually
cause
your
sister
whom
i
greatly
respect
some
trouble
and
unpleasantness
and
so
sincerely
regretting
it
i
want
not
to
compensate
not
to
repay
her
for
the
unpleasantness
but
simply
to
do
something
to
her
advantage
to
show
that
i
am
not
after
all
privileged
to
do
nothing
but
harm
if
there
were
a
millionth
fraction
of
in
my
offer
i
should
not
have
made
it
so
openly
and
i
should
not
have
offered
her
ten
thousand
only
when
five
week
ago
i
offered
her
more
besides
i
may
perhaps
very
soon
marry
a
young
lady
and
that
alone
ought
to
prevent
suspicion
of
any
design
on
avdotya
romanovna
in
conclusion
let
me
say
that
in
marrying
luzhin
she
is
taking
money
just
the
same
only
from
another
man
don
t
be
angry
rodion
romanovitch
think
it
over
coolly
and
svidrigaïlov
himself
wa
exceedingly
cool
and
quiet
a
he
wa
saying
this
i
beg
you
to
say
no
more
said
raskolnikov
in
any
case
this
is
unpardonable
not
in
the
least
then
a
man
may
do
nothing
but
harm
to
his
neighbour
in
this
world
and
is
prevented
from
doing
the
tiniest
bit
of
good
by
trivial
conventional
formality
that
s
absurd
if
i
died
for
instance
and
left
that
sum
to
your
sister
in
my
will
surely
she
wouldn
t
refuse
it
very
likely
she
oh
no
indeed
however
if
you
refuse
it
so
be
it
though
ten
thousand
rouble
is
a
capital
thing
to
have
on
occasion
in
any
case
i
beg
you
to
repeat
what
i
have
said
to
avdotya
no
i
won
in
that
case
rodion
romanovitch
i
shall
be
obliged
to
try
and
see
her
myself
and
worry
her
by
doing
and
if
i
do
tell
her
will
you
not
try
to
see
her
i
don
t
know
really
what
to
say
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
her
once
don
t
hope
for
i
m
sorry
but
you
don
t
know
me
perhaps
we
may
become
better
you
think
we
may
become
friend
and
why
not
svidrigaïlov
said
smiling
he
stood
up
and
took
his
hat
i
didn
t
quite
intend
to
disturb
you
and
i
came
here
without
reckoning
on
it
though
i
wa
very
much
struck
by
your
face
this
where
did
you
see
me
this
morning
raskolnikov
asked
uneasily
i
saw
you
by
chance
i
kept
fancying
there
is
something
about
you
like
me
but
don
t
be
uneasy
i
am
not
intrusive
i
used
to
get
on
all
right
with
and
i
never
bored
prince
svirbey
a
great
personage
who
is
a
distant
relation
of
mine
and
i
could
write
about
raphael
s
in
madam
prilukov
s
album
and
i
never
left
marfa
petrovna
s
side
for
seven
year
and
i
used
to
stay
the
night
at
viazemsky
s
house
in
the
hay
market
in
the
old
day
and
i
may
go
up
in
a
balloon
with
berg
oh
all
right
are
you
starting
soon
on
your
travel
may
i
ask
what
travel
why
on
that
journey
you
spoke
of
it
a
journey
oh
yes
i
did
speak
of
a
journey
well
that
s
a
wide
subject
if
only
you
knew
what
you
are
asking
he
added
and
gave
a
sudden
loud
short
laugh
perhaps
i
ll
get
married
instead
of
the
journey
they
re
making
a
match
for
here
how
have
you
had
time
for
that
but
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
avdotya
romanovna
once
i
earnestly
beg
it
well
for
the
present
oh
yes
i
have
forgotten
something
tell
your
sister
rodion
romanovitch

marfa
petrovna
remembered
her
in
her
will
and
left
her
three
thousand
rouble
that
s
absolutely
certain
marfa
petrovna
arranged
it
a
week
before
her
death
and
it
wa
done
in
my
presence
avdotya
romanovna

be
able
to
receive

money

two
or
three

this
marfa
petrovna
begged
dounia
s
forgiveness
afterwards
and
she
s
just
died
suddenly
it
wa
of
her
we
were
talking
this
morning
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
afraid
of
that
man
he
came
here
at
once
after
his
wife
s
funeral
he
is
very
strange
and
is
determined
on
doing
something
we
must
guard
dounia
from
him
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
do
you
hear
guard
her
what
can
he
do
to
harm
avdotya
romanovna
thank
you
rodya
for
speaking
to
me
like
that
we
will
we
will
guard
her
where
doe
he
live
i
don
t
why
didn
t
you
ask
what
a
pity
i
ll
find
out
did
you
see
him
asked
raskolnikov
after
a
pause
yes
i
noticed
him
i
noticed
him
you
did
really
see
him
you
saw
him
clearly
raskolnikov
insisted
yes
i
remember
him
perfectly
i
should
know
him
in
a
thousand
i
have
a
good
memory
for
they
were
silent
again
hm
that
s
all
right
muttered
raskolnikov
do
you
know
i
fancied
i
keep
thinking
that
it
may
have
been
an
what
do
you
mean
i
don
t
understand
well
you
all
say
raskolnikov
went
on
twisting
his
mouth
into
a
smile
that
i
am
mad
i
thought
just
now
that
perhaps
i
really
am
mad
and
have
only
seen
a
what
do
you
mean
why
who
can
tell
perhaps
i
am
really
mad
and
perhaps
everything
that
happened
all
these
day
may
be
only
ach
rodya
you
have
been
upset
again
but
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
come
for
raskolnikov
did
not
answer
razumihin
thought
a
minute
now
let
me
tell
you
my
story
he
began
i
came
to
you
you
were
asleep
then
we
had
dinner
and
then
i
went
to
porfiry
s
zametov
wa
still
with
him
i
tried
to
begin
but
it
wa
no
use
i
couldn
t
speak
in
the
right
way
they
don
t
seem
to
understand
and
can
t
understand
but
are
not
a
bit
ashamed
i
drew
porfiry
to
the
window
and
began
talking
to
him
but
it
wa
still
no
use
he
looked
away
and
i
looked
away
at
last
i
shook
my
fist
in
his
ugly
face
and
told
him
a
a
cousin
i
d
brain
him
he
merely
looked
at
me
i
cursed
and
came
away
that
wa
all
it
wa
very
stupid
to
zametov
i
didn
t
say
a
word
but
you
see
i
thought
i
d
made
a
mess
of
it
but
a
i
went
downstairs
a
brilliant
idea
struck
me
why
should
we
trouble
of
course
if
you
were
in
any
danger
or
anything
but
why
need
you
care
you
needn
t
care
a
hang
for
them
we
shall
have
a
laugh
at
them
afterwards
and
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
d
mystify
them
more
than
ever
how
ashamed
they
ll
be
afterwards
hang
them
we
can
thrash
them
afterwards
but
let
s
laugh
at
them
now
to
be
sure
answered
raskolnikov
but
what
will
you
say
he
thought
to
himself
strange
to
say
till
that
moment
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
what
razumihin
would
think
when
he
knew
a
he
thought
it
raskolnikov
looked
at
him
razumihin
s
account
of
his
visit
to
porfiry
had
very
little
interest
for
him
so
much
had
come
and
gone
since
then
in
the
corridor
they
came
upon
luzhin
he
had
arrived
punctually
at
eight
and
wa
looking
for
the
number
so
that
all
three
went
in
together
without
greeting
or
looking
at
one
another
the
young
men
walked
in
first
while
pyotr
petrovitch
for
good
manner
lingered
a
little
in
the
passage
taking
off
his
coat
pulcheria
alexandrovna
came
forward
at
once
to
greet
him
in
the
doorway
dounia
wa
welcoming
her
brother
pyotr
petrovitch
walked
in
and
quite
amiably
though
with
redoubled
dignity
bowed
to
the
lady
he
looked
however
a
though
he
were
a
little
put
out
and
could
not
yet
recover
himself
pulcheria
alexandrovna
who
seemed
also
a
little
embarrassed
hastened
to
make
them
all
sit
down
at
the
round
table
where
a
samovar
wa
boiling
dounia
and
luzhin
were
facing
one
another
on
opposite
side
of
the
table
razumihin
and
raskolnikov
were
facing
pulcheria
alexandrovna
razumihin
wa
next
to
luzhin
and
raskolnikov
wa
beside
his
sister
a
moment
s
silence
followed
pyotr
petrovitch
deliberately
drew
out
a
cambric
handkerchief
reeking
of
scent
and
blew
his
nose
with
an
air
of
a
benevolent
man
who
felt
himself
slighted
and
wa
firmly
resolved
to
insist
on
an
explanation
in
the
passage
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
to
keep
on
his
overcoat
and
walk
away
and
so
give
the
two
lady
a
sharp
and
emphatic
lesson
and
make
them
feel
the
gravity
of
the
position
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
this
besides
he
could
not
endure
uncertainty
and
he
wanted
an
explanation
if
his
request
had
been
so
openly
disobeyed
there
wa
something
behind
it
and
in
that
case
it
wa
better
to
find
it
out
beforehand
it
rested
with
him
to
punish
them
and
there
would
always
be
time
for
that
i
trust
you
had
a
favourable
journey
he
inquired
officially
of
pulcheria
alexandrovna
oh
very
pyotr
i
am
gratified
to
hear
it
and
avdotya
romanovna
is
not
either
i
am
young
and
strong
i
don
t
get
tired
but
it
wa
a
great
strain
for
mother
answered
dounia
that
s
unavoidable
our
national
railway
are
of
terrible
length
mother
russia
a
they
say
is
a
vast
country
in
spite
of
all
my
desire
to
do
so
i
wa
unable
to
meet
you
yesterday
but
i
trust
all
passed
off
without
inconvenience
oh
no
pyotr
petrovitch
it
wa
all
terribly
disheartening
pulcheria
alexandrovna
hastened
to
declare
with
peculiar
intonation
and
if
dmitri
prokofitch
had
not
been
sent
u
i
really
believe
by
god
himself
we
should
have
been
utterly
lost
here
he
is
dmitri
prokofitch
razumihin
she
added
introducing
him
to
luzhin
i
had
the
pleasure
yesterday
muttered
pyotr
petrovitch
with
a
hostile
glance
sidelong
at
razumihin
then
he
scowled
and
wa
silent
pyotr
petrovitch
belonged
to
that
class
of
person
on
the
surface
very
polite
in
society
who
make
a
great
point
of
punctiliousness
but
who
directly
they
are
crossed
in
anything
are
completely
disconcerted
and
become
more
like
sack
of
flour
than
elegant
and
lively
men
of
society
again
all
wa
silent
raskolnikov
wa
obstinately
mute
avdotya
romanovna
wa
unwilling
to
open
the
conversation
too
soon
razumihin
had
nothing
to
say
so
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
anxious
again
marfa
petrovna
is
dead
have
you
heard
she
began
having
recourse
to
her
leading
item
of
conversation
to
be
sure
i
heard
so
i
wa
immediately
informed
and
i
have
come
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
arkady
ivanovitch
svidrigaïlov
set
off
in
haste
for
petersburg
immediately
after
his
wife
s
funeral
so
at
least
i
have
excellent
authority
for
to
petersburg
here
dounia
asked
in
alarm
and
looked
at
her
mother
yes
indeed
and
doubtless
not
without
some
design
having
in
view
the
rapidity
of
his
departure
and
all
the
circumstance
preceding
good
heaven
won
t
he
leave
dounia
in
peace
even
here
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
i
imagine
that
neither
you
nor
avdotya
romanovna
have
any
ground
for
uneasiness
unless
of
course
you
are
yourselves
desirous
of
getting
into
communication
with
him
for
my
part
i
am
on
my
guard
and
am
now
discovering
where
he
is
oh
pyotr
petrovitch
you
would
not
believe
what
a
fright
you
have
given
me
pulcheria
alexandrovna
went
on
i
ve
only
seen
him
twice
but
i
thought
him
terrible
terrible
i
am
convinced
that
he
wa
the
cause
of
marfa
petrovna
s
it
s
impossible
to
be
certain
about
that
i
have
precise
information
i
do
not
dispute
that
he
may
have
contributed
to
accelerate
the
course
of
event
by
the
moral
influence
so
to
say
of
the
affront
but
a
to
the
general
conduct
and
moral
characteristic
of
that
personage
i
am
in
agreement
with
you
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
well
off
now
and
precisely
what
marfa
petrovna
left
him
this
will
be
known
to
me
within
a
very
short
period
but
no
doubt
here
in
petersburg
if
he
ha
any
pecuniary
resource
he
will
relapse
at
once
into
his
old
way
he
is
the
most
depraved
and
abjectly
vicious
specimen
of
that
class
of
men
i
have
considerable
reason
to
believe
that
marfa
petrovna
who
wa
so
unfortunate
a
to
fall
in
love
with
him
and
to
pay
his
debt
eight
year
ago
wa
of
service
to
him
also
in
another
way
solely
by
her
exertion
and
sacrifice
a
criminal
charge
involving
an
element
of
fantastic
and
homicidal
brutality
for
which
he
might
well
have
been
sentenced
to
siberia
wa
hushed
up
that
s
the
sort
of
man
he
is
if
you
care
to
good
heaven
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
raskolnikov
listened
attentively
are
you
speaking
the
truth
when
you
say
that
you
have
good
evidence
of
this
dounia
asked
sternly
and
emphatically
i
only
repeat
what
i
wa
told
in
secret
by
marfa
petrovna
i
must
observe
that
from
the
legal
point
of
view
the
case
wa
far
from
clear
there
wa
and
i
believe
still
is
living
here
a
woman
called
resslich
a
foreigner
who
lent
small
sum
of
money
at
interest
and
did
other
commission
and
with
this
woman
svidrigaïlov
had
for
a
long
while
close
and
mysterious
relation
she
had
a
relation
a
niece
i
believe
living
with
her
a
deaf
and
dumb
girl
of
fifteen
or
perhaps
not
more
than
fourteen
resslich
hated
this
girl
and
grudged
her
every
crust
she
used
to
beat
her
mercilessly
one
day
the
girl
wa
found
hanging
in
the
garret
at
the
inquest
the
verdict
wa
suicide
after
the
usual
proceeding
the
matter
ended
but
later
on
information
wa
given
that
the
child
had
been
cruelly
outraged
by
svidrigaïlov
it
is
true
this
wa
not
clearly
established
the
information
wa
given
by
another
german
woman
of
loose
character
whose
word
could
not
be
trusted
no
statement
wa
actually
made
to
the
police
thanks
to
marfa
petrovna
s
money
and
exertion
it
did
not
get
beyond
gossip
and
yet
the
story
is
a
very
significant
one
you
heard
no
doubt
avdotya
romanovna
when
you
were
with
them
the
story
of
the
servant
philip
who
died
of
ill
treatment
he
received
six
year
ago
before
the
abolition
of
i
heard
on
the
contrary
that
this
philip
hanged
quite
so
but
what
drove
him
or
rather
perhaps
disposed
him
to
suicide
wa
the
systematic
persecution
and
severity
of
i
don
t
know
that
answered
dounia
dryly
i
only
heard
a
queer
story
that
philip
wa
a
sort
of
hypochondriac
a
sort
of
domestic
philosopher
the
servant
used
to
say
he
read
himself
silly
and
that
he
hanged
himself
partly
on
account
of
svidrigaïlov
s
mockery
of
him
and
not
his
blow
when
i
wa
there
he
behaved
well
to
the
servant
and
they
were
actually
fond
of
him
though
they
certainly
did
blame
him
for
philip
s
i
perceive
avdotya
romanovna
that
you
seem
disposed
to
undertake
his
defence
all
of
a
sudden
luzhin
observed
twisting
his
lip
into
an
ambiguous
smile
there
s
no
doubt
that
he
is
an
astute
man
and
insinuating
where
lady
are
concerned
of
which
marfa
petrovna
who
ha
died
so
strangely
is
a
terrible
instance
my
only
desire
ha
been
to
be
of
service
to
you
and
your
mother
with
my
advice
in
view
of
the
renewed
effort
which
may
certainly
be
anticipated
from
him
for
my
part
it
s
my
firm
conviction
that
he
will
end
in
a
debtor
s
prison
again
marfa
petrovna
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
settling
anything
substantial
on
him
having
regard
for
his
child
s
interest
and
if
she
left
him
anything
it
would
only
be
the
merest
sufficiency
something
insignificant
and
ephemeral
which
would
not
last
a
year
for
a
man
of
his
pyotr
petrovitch
i
beg
you
said
dounia

no
more
of
svidrigaïlov

make
me
he
ha
just
been
to
see
me
said
raskolnikov
breaking
his
silence
for
the
first
time
there
were
exclamation
from
all
and
they
all
turned
to
him
even
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
roused
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
he
came
in
when
i
wa
asleep
waked
me
and
introduced
himself
raskolnikov
continued
he
wa
fairly
cheerful
and
at
ease
and
quite
hope
that
we
shall
become
friend
he
is
particularly
anxious
by
the
way
dounia
for
an
interview
with
you
at
which
he
asked
me
to
assist
he
ha
a
proposition
to
make
to
you
and
he
told
me
about
it
he
told
me
too
that
a
week
before
her
death
marfa
petrovna
left
you
three
thousand
rouble
in
her
will
dounia
and
that
you
can
receive
the
money
very
thank
god
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
crossing
herself
pray
for
her
soul
dounia
it
s
a
fact
broke
from
luzhin
tell
u
what
more
dounia
urged
raskolnikov
then
he
said
that
he
wasn
t
rich
and
all
the
estate
wa
left
to
his
child
who
are
now
with
an
aunt
then
that
he
wa
staying
somewhere
not
far
from
me
but
where
i
don
t
know
i
didn
t
ask
but
what
what
doe
he
want
to
propose
to
dounia
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
in
a
fright
did
he
tell
you
what
wa
it
i
ll
tell
you
raskolnikov
ceased
speaking
and
turned
his
attention
to
his
tea
pyotr
petrovitch
looked
at
his
watch
i
am
compelled
to
keep
a
business
engagement
and
so
i
shall
not
be
in
your
way
he
added
with
an
air
of
some
pique
and
he
began
getting
up
don
t
go
pyotr
petrovitch
said
dounia
you
intended
to
spend
the
evening
besides
you
wrote
yourself
that
you
wanted
to
have
an
explanation
with
precisely
so
avdotya
romanovna
pyotr
petrovitch
answered
impressively
sitting
down
again
but
still
holding
his
hat
i
certainly
desired
an
explanation
with
you
and
your
honoured
mother
upon
a
very
important
point
indeed
but
a
your
brother
can
not
speak
openly
in
my
presence
of
some
proposal
of
svidrigaïlov
i
too
do
not
desire
and
am
not
able
to
speak
openly
in
the
presence
of
others
of
certain
matter
of
the
greatest
gravity
moreover
my
most
weighty
and
urgent
request
ha
been
disregarded
assuming
an
aggrieved
air
luzhin
relapsed
into
dignified
silence
your
request
that
my
brother
should
not
be
present
at
our
meeting
wa
disregarded
solely
at
my
insistence
said
dounia
you
wrote
that
you
had
been
insulted
by
my
brother
i
think
that
this
must
be
explained
at
once
and
you
must
be
reconciled
and
if
rodya
really
ha
insulted
you
then
he
and
pyotr
petrovitch
took
a
stronger
line
there
are
insult
avdotya
romanovna
which
no
goodwill
can
make
u
forget
there
is
a
line
in
everything
which
it
is
dangerous
to
overstep
and
when
it
ha
been
overstepped
there
is
no
that
wasn
t
what
i
wa
speaking
of
exactly
pyotr
petrovitch
dounia
interrupted
with
some
impatience
please
understand
that
our
whole
future
depends
now
on
whether
all
this
is
explained
and
set
right
a
soon
a
possible
i
tell
you
frankly
at
the
start
that
i
can
not
look
at
it
in
any
other
light
and
if
you
have
the
least
regard
for
me
all
this
business
must
be
ended
however
hard
that
may
be
i
repeat
that
if
my
brother
is
to
blame
he
will
ask
your
i
am
surprised
at
your
putting
the
question
like
that
said
luzhin
getting
more
and
more
irritated
esteeming
and
so
to
say
adoring
you
i
may
at
the
same
time
very
well
indeed
be
able
to
dislike
some
member
of
your
family
though
i
lay
claim
to
the
happiness
of
your
hand
i
can
not
accept
duty
incompatible
with
ah
don
t
be
so
ready
to
take
offence
pyotr
petrovitch
dounia
interrupted
with
feeling
and
be
the
sensible
and
generous
man
i
have
always
considered
and
wish
to
consider
you
to
be
i
ve
given
you
a
great
promise
i
am
your
betrothed
trust
me
in
this
matter
and
believe
me
i
shall
be
capable
of
judging
impartially
my
assuming
the
part
of
judge
is
a
much
a
surprise
for
my
brother
a
for
you
when
i
insisted
on
his
coming
to
our
interview
after
your
letter
i
told
him
nothing
of
what
i
meant
to
do
understand
that
if
you
are
not
reconciled
i
must
choose
between
you
it
must
be
either
you
or
he
that
is
how
the
question
rest
on
your
side
and
on
his
i
don
t
want
to
be
mistaken
in
my
choice
and
i
must
not
be
for
your
sake
i
must
break
off
with
my
brother
for
my
brother
s
sake
i
must
break
off
with
you
i
can
find
out
for
certain
now
whether
he
is
a
brother
to
me
and
i
want
to
know
it
and
of
you
whether
i
am
dear
to
you
whether
you
esteem
me
whether
you
are
the
husband
for
avdotya
romanovna
luzhin
declared
huffily
your
word
are
of
too
much
consequence
to
me
i
will
say
more
they
are
offensive
in
view
of
the
position
i
have
the
honour
to
occupy
in
relation
to
you
to
say
nothing
of
your
strange
and
offensive
setting
me
on
a
level
with
an
impertinent
boy
you
admit
the
possibility
of
breaking
your
promise
to
me
you
say
you
or
he
showing
thereby
of
how
little
consequence
i
am
in
your
eye
i
can
not
let
this
pas
considering
the
relationship
and
the
obligation
existing
between
what
cried
dounia
flushing
i
set
your
interest
beside
all
that
ha
hitherto
been
most
precious
in
my
life
what
ha
made
up
the
of
my
life
and
here
you
are
offended
at
my
making
too
account
of
raskolnikov
smiled
sarcastically
razumihin
fidgeted
but
pyotr
petrovitch
did
not
accept
the
reproof
on
the
contrary
at
every
word
he
became
more
persistent
and
irritable
a
though
he
relished
it
love
for
the
future
partner
of
your
life
for
your
husband
ought
to
outweigh
your
love
for
your
brother
he
pronounced
sententiously
and
in
any
case
i
can
not
be
put
on
the
same
level
although
i
said
so
emphatically
that
i
would
not
speak
openly
in
your
brother
s
presence
nevertheless
i
intend
now
to
ask
your
honoured
mother
for
a
necessary
explanation
on
a
point
of
great
importance
closely
affecting
my
dignity
your
son
he
turned
to
pulcheria
alexandrovna
yesterday
in
the
presence
of
razsudkin
or
i
think
that
s
it
excuse
me
i
have
forgotten
your
surname
he
bowed
politely
to
razumihin
insulted
me
by
misrepresenting
the
idea
i
expressed
to
you
in
a
private
conversation
drinking
coffee
that
is
that
marriage
with
a
poor
girl
who
ha
had
experience
of
trouble
is
more
advantageous
from
the
conjugal
point
of
view
than
with
one
who
ha
lived
in
luxury
since
it
is
more
profitable
for
the
moral
character
your
son
intentionally
exaggerated
the
significance
of
my
word
and
made
them
ridiculous
accusing
me
of
malicious
intention
and
a
far
a
i
could
see
relied
upon
your
correspondence
with
him
i
shall
consider
myself
happy
pulcheria
alexandrovna
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
convince
me
of
an
opposite
conclusion
and
thereby
considerately
reassure
me
kindly
let
me
know
in
what
term
precisely
you
repeated
my
word
in
your
letter
to
rodion
i
don
t
remember
faltered
pulcheria
alexandrovna
i
repeated
them
a
i
understood
them
i
don
t
know
how
rodya
repeated
them
to
you
perhaps
he
he
could
not
have
exaggerated
them
except
at
your
pyotr
petrovitch
pulcheria
alexandrovna
declared
with
dignity
the
proof
that
dounia
and
i
did
not
take
your
word
in
a
very
bad
sense
is
the
fact
that
we
are
good
mother
said
dounia
approvingly
then
this
is
my
fault
again
said
luzhin
aggrieved
well
pyotr
petrovitch
you
keep
blaming
rodion
but
you
yourself
have
just
written
what
wa
false
about
him
pulcheria
alexandrovna
added
gaining
courage
i
don
t
remember
writing
anything
you
wrote
raskolnikov
said
sharply
not
turning
to
luzhin
that
i
gave
money
yesterday
not
to
the
widow
of
the
man
who
wa
killed
a
wa
the
fact
but
to
his
daughter
whom
i
had
never
seen
till
yesterday
you
wrote
this
to
make
dissension
between
me
and
my
family
and
for
that
object
added
coarse
expression
about
the
conduct
of
a
girl
whom
you
don
t
know
all
that
is
mean
excuse
me
sir
said
luzhin
quivering
with
fury
i
enlarged
upon
your
quality
and
conduct
in
my
letter
solely
in
response
to
your
sister
s
and
mother
s
inquiry
how
i
found
you
and
what
impression
you
made
on
me
a
for
what
you
ve
alluded
to
in
my
letter
be
so
good
a
to
point
out
one
word
of
falsehood
show
that
is
that
you
didn
t
throw
away
your
money
and
that
there
are
not
worthless
person
in
that
family
however
to
my
thinking
you
with
all
your
virtue
are
not
worth
the
little
finger
of
that
unfortunate
girl
at
whom
you
throw
would
you
go
so
far
then
a
to
let
her
associate
with
your
mother
and
sister
i
have
done
so
already
if
you
care
to
know
i
made
her
sit
down
with
mother
and
rodya
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
dounia
crimsoned
razumihin
knitted
his
brow
luzhin
smiled
with
lofty
sarcasm
you
may
see
for
yourself
avdotya
romanovna
he
said
whether
it
is
possible
for
u
to
agree
i
hope
now
that
this
question
is
at
an
end
once
and
for
all
i
will
withdraw
that
i
may
not
hinder
the
pleasure
of
family
intimacy
and
the
discussion
of
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
took
his
hat
but
in
withdrawing
i
venture
to
request
that
for
the
future
i
may
be
spared
similar
meeting
and
so
to
say
compromise
i
appeal
particularly
to
you
honoured
pulcheria
alexandrovna
on
this
subject
the
more
a
my
letter

addressed

you

to
no
one

you
seem
to
think
we
are
completely
under
your
authority
pyotr
petrovitch
dounia
ha
told
you
the
reason
your
desire
wa
disregarded
she
had
the
best
intention
and
indeed
you
write
a
though
you
were
laying
command
upon
me
are
we
to
consider
every
desire
of
yours
a
a
command
let
me
tell
you
on
the
contrary
that
you
ought
to
show
particular
delicacy
and
consideration
for
u
now
because
we
have
thrown
up
everything
and
have
come
here
relying
on
you
and
so
we
are
in
any
case
in
a
sense
in
your
that
is
not
quite
true
pulcheria

especially
at
the
present
moment
when
the
news
ha
come
of
marfa
petrovna
s
legacy
which
seems
indeed
very
apropos
judging
from
the
new
tone
you
take
to
me
he
added
sarcastically
judging
from
that
remark
we
may
certainly
presume
that
you
were
reckoning
on
our
helplessness
dounia
observed
irritably
but
now
in
any
case
i
can
not
reckon
on
it
and
i
particularly
desire
not
to
hinder
your
discussion
of
the
secret
proposal
of
arkady
ivanovitch
svidrigaïlov
which
he
ha
entrusted
to
your
brother
and
which
have
i
perceive
a
great
and
possibly
a
very
agreeable
interest

good

away
she
turned
to
him
white
with
anger
pyotr
petrovitch
had
apparently
not
at
all
expected
such
a
conclusion
he
had
too
much
confidence
in
himself
in
his
power
and
in
the
helplessness
of
his
victim
he
could
not
believe
it
even
now
he
turned
pale
and
his

if
i
go
out
of
this
door
now
after
such
a
dismissal
then
you
may
reckon
on
it
i
will
never
come
back
consider
what
you
are
doing
my
word
is
not

insolence
cried
dounia
springing
up
from
her
seat
i
don
t
want
you
to
come
back
what
so
that
s
how
it
stand
cried
luzhin
utterly
unable
to
the
last
moment
to
believe
in
the
rupture
and
so
completely
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
now
so
that
s
how
it
stand
but
do
you
know
avdotya
romanovna
that
i
might
protest
what
right
have
you
to
speak
to
her
like
that
pulcheria
alexandrovna
intervened
hotly
and
what
can
you
protest
about
what
right
have
you
am
i
to
give
my
dounia
to
a
man
like
you
go
away
leave
u
altogether
we
are
to
blame
for
having
agreed
to
a
wrong
action
and
i
above
all
but
you
have
bound
me
pulcheria
alexandrovna
luzhin
stormed
in
a
frenzy
by
your
promise
and
now
you
deny
it
and
besides
i
have
been
led
on
account
of
that
into
expense
this
last
complaint
wa
so
characteristic
of
pyotr
petrovitch
that
raskolnikov
pale
with
anger
and
with
the
effort
of
restraining
it
could
not
help
breaking
into
laughter
but
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
furious
expense
what
expense
are
you
speaking
of
our
trunk
but
the
conductor
brought
it
for
nothing
for
you
mercy
on
u
we

avdotya

implored
pyotr
petrovitch
do
be
kind
and
go
i
am
going
but
one
last
word
he
said
quite
unable
to
control
himself
your
mamma
seems
to
have
entirely
forgotten
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
you
so
to
speak
after
the
gossip
of
the
town
had
spread
all
over
the
district
in
regard
to
your
reputation
disregarding
public
opinion
for
your
sake
and
reinstating
your
reputation
i
certainly
might
very
well
reckon
on
a
fitting
return
and
might
indeed
look
for
gratitude
on
your
part
and
my
eye
have
only
now
been
opened
i
see
myself
that
i
may
have
acted
very
very
recklessly
in
disregarding
the
universal
verdict
doe
the
fellow
want
his
head
smashed
cried
razumihin
jumping
up
you
are
a
mean
and
spiteful
man
cried
dounia
not
a
word
not
a
movement
cried
raskolnikov
holding
razumihin
back
then
going
close
up
to
luzhin
kindly
leave
the
room
he
said
quietly
and
distinctly
and
not
a
word
more
or
pyotr
petrovitch
gazed
at
him
for
some
second
with
a
pale
face
that
worked
with
anger
then
he
turned
went
out
and
rarely
ha
any
man
carried
away
in
his
heart
such
vindictive
hatred
a
he
felt
against
raskolnikov
him
and
him
alone
he
blamed
for
everything
it
is
noteworthy
that
a
he
went
downstairs
he
still
imagined
that
his
case
wa
perhaps
not
utterly
lost
and
that
so
far
a
the
lady
were
concerned
all
might
very
well
indeed
be
set
right
again
chapter
iii
the
fact
wa
that
up
to
the
last
moment
he
had
never
expected
such
an
ending
he
had
been
overbearing
to
the
last
degree
never
dreaming
that
two
destitute
and
defenceless
woman
could
escape
from
his
control
this
conviction
wa
strengthened
by
his
vanity
and
conceit
a
conceit
to
the
point
of
fatuity
pyotr
petrovitch
who
had
made
his
way
up
from
insignificance
wa
morbidly
given
to
had
the
highest
opinion
of
his
intelligence
and
capacity
and
sometimes
even
gloated
in
solitude
over
his
image
in
the
glass
but
what
he
loved
and
valued
above
all
wa
the
money
he
had
amassed
by
his
labour
and
by
all
sort
of
device
that
money
made
him
the
equal
of
all
who
had
been
his
superior
when
he
had
bitterly
reminded
dounia
that
he
had
decided
to
take
her
in
spite
of
evil
report
pyotr
petrovitch
had
spoken
with
perfect
sincerity
and
had
indeed
felt
genuinely
indignant
at
such
black
and
yet
when
he
made
dounia
his
offer
he
wa
fully
aware
of
the
groundlessness
of
all
the
gossip
the
story
had
been
everywhere
contradicted
by
marfa
petrovna
and
wa
by
then
disbelieved
by
all
the
townspeople
who
were
warm
in
dounia
s
defence
and
he
would
not
have
denied
that
he
knew
all
that
at
the
time
yet
he
still
thought
highly
of
his
own
resolution
in
lifting
dounia
to
his
level
and
regarded
it
a
something
heroic
in
speaking
of
it
to
dounia
he
had
let
out
the
secret
feeling
he
cherished
and
admired
and
he
could
not
understand
that
others
should
fail
to
admire
it
too
he
had
called
on
raskolnikov
with
the
feeling
of
a
benefactor
who
is
about
to
reap
the
fruit
of
his
good
deed
and
to
hear
agreeable
flattery
and
a
he
went
downstairs
now
he
considered
himself
most
undeservedly
injured
and
unrecognised
dounia
wa
simply
essential
to
him
to
do
without
her
wa
unthinkable
for
many
year
he
had
had
voluptuous
dream
of
marriage
but
he
had
gone
on
waiting
and
amassing
money
he
brooded
with
relish
in
profound
secret
over
the
image
of
a
girl
virtuous
poor
she
must
be
poor
very
young
very
pretty
of
good
birth
and
education
very
timid
one
who
had
suffered
much
and
wa
completely
humbled
before
him
one
who
would
all
her
life
look
on
him
a
her
saviour
worship
him
admire
him
and
only
him
how
many
scene
how
many
amorous
episode
he
had
imagined
on
this
seductive
and
playful
theme
when
his
work
wa
over
and
behold
the
dream
of
so
many
year
wa
all
but
realised
the
beauty
and
education
of
avdotya
romanovna
had
impressed
him
her
helpless
position
had
been
a
great
allurement
in
her
he
had
found
even
more
than
he
dreamed
of
here
wa
a
girl
of
pride
character
virtue
of
education
and
breeding
superior
to
his
own
he
felt
that
and
this
creature
would
be
slavishly
grateful
all
her
life
for
his
heroic
condescension
and
would
humble
herself
in
the
dust
before
him
and
he
would
have
absolute
unbounded
power
over
her
not
long
before
he
had
too
after
long
reflection
and
hesitation
made
an
important
change
in
his
career
and
wa
now
entering
on
a
wider
circle
of
business
with
this
change
his
cherished
dream
of
rising
into
a
higher
class
of
society
seemed
likely
to
be
realised
he
wa
in
fact
determined
to
try
his
fortune
in
petersburg
he
knew
that
woman
could
do
a
very
great
deal
the
fascination
of
a
charming
virtuous
highly
educated
woman
might
make
his
way
easier
might
do
wonder
in
attracting
people
to
him
throwing
an
aureole
round
him
and
now
everything
wa
in
ruin
this
sudden
horrible
rupture
affected
him
like
a
clap
of
thunder
it
wa
like
a
hideous
joke
an
absurdity
he
had
only
been
a
tiny
bit
masterful
had
not
even
time
to
speak
out
had
simply
made
a
joke
been
carried
away
and
it
had
ended
so
seriously
and
of
course
too
he
did
love
dounia
in
his
own
way
he
already
possessed
her
in
his
dream
and
all
at
once
no
the
next
day
the
very
next
day
it
must
all
be
set
right
smoothed
over
settled
above
all
he
must
crush
that
conceited
milksop
who
wa
the
cause
of
it
all
with
a
sick
feeling
he
could
not
help
recalling
razumihin
too
but
he
soon
reassured
himself
on
that
score
a
though
a
fellow
like
that
could
be
put
on
a
level
with
him
the
man
he
really
dreaded
in
earnest
wa
svidrigaïlov
he
had
in
short
a
great
deal
to
attend
to
no
i
i
am
more
to
blame
than
anyone
said
dounia
kissing
and
embracing
her
mother
i
wa
tempted
by
his
money
but
on
my
honour
brother
i
had
no
idea
he
wa
such
a
base
man
if
i
had
seen
through
him
before
nothing
would
have
tempted
me
don

alexandrovna
muttered
but
half
consciously
a
though
scarcely
able
to
realise
what
had
happened
they
were
all
relieved
and
in
five
minute
they
were
laughing
only
now
and
then
dounia
turned
white
and
frowned
remembering
what
had
passed
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
surprised
to
find
that
she
too
wa
glad
she
had
only
that
morning
thought
rupture
with
luzhin
a
terrible
misfortune
razumihin
wa
delighted
he
did
not
yet
dare
to
express
his
joy
fully
but
he
wa
in
a
fever
of
excitement
a
though
a
had
fallen
off
his
heart
now
he
had
the
right
to
devote
his
life
to
them
to
serve
them
anything
might
happen
now
but
he
felt
afraid
to
think
of
further
possibility
and
dared
not
let
his
imagination
range
but
raskolnikov
sat
still
in
the
same
place
almost
sullen
and
indifferent
though
he
had
been
the
most
insistent
on
getting
rid
of
luzhin
he
seemed
now
the
least
concerned
at
what
had
happened
dounia
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
wa
still
angry
with
her
and
pulcheria
alexandrovna
watched
him
timidly
what
did
svidrigaïlov
say
to
you
said
dounia
approaching
him
yes
yes
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
raskolnikov
raised
his
head
he
want
to
make
you
a
present
of
ten
thousand
rouble
and
he
desire
to
see
you
once
in
my
see
her
on
no
account
cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
and
how
dare
he
offer
her
money
then
raskolnikov
repeated
rather
dryly
his
conversation
with
svidrigaïlov
omitting
his
account
of
the
ghostly
visitation
of
marfa
petrovna
wishing
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
talk
what
answer
did
you
give
him
asked
dounia
at
first
i
said
i
would
not
take
any
message
to
you
then
he
said
that
he
would
do
his
utmost
to
obtain
an
interview
with
you
without
my
help
he
assured
me
that
his
passion
for
you
wa
a
passing
infatuation
now
he
ha
no
feeling
for
you
he
doesn
t
want
you
to
marry
luzhin
his
talk
wa
altogether
rather
how
do
you
explain
him
to
yourself
rodya
how
did
he
strike
you
i
must
confess
i
don
t
quite
understand
him
he
offer
you
ten
thousand
and
yet
say
he
is
not
well
off
he
say
he
is
going
away
and
in
ten
minute
he
forgets
he
ha
said
it
then
he
say
he
is
going
to
be
married
and
ha
already
fixed
on
the
girl
no
doubt
he
ha
a
motive
and
probably
a
bad
one
but
it
s
odd
that
he
should
be
so
clumsy
about
it
if
he
had
any
design
against
you
of
course
i
refused
this
money
on
your
account
once
for
all
altogether
i
thought
him
very
strange
one
might
almost
think
he
wa
mad
but
i
may
be
mistaken
that
may
only
be
the
part
he
assumes
the
death
of
marfa
petrovna
seems
to
have
made
a
great
impression
on
god
rest
her
soul
exclaimed
pulcheria
alexandrovna
i
shall
always
always
pray
for
her
where
should
we
be
now
dounia
without
this
three
thousand
it
s
a
though
it
had
fallen
from
heaven
why
rodya
this
morning
we
had
only
three
rouble
in
our
pocket
and
dounia
and
i
were
just
planning
to
pawn
her
watch
so
a
to
avoid
borrowing
from
that
man
until
he
offered
dounia
seemed
strangely
impressed
by
svidrigaïlov
s
offer
she
still
stood
meditating
he
ha
got
some
terrible
plan
she
said
in
a
half
whisper
to
herself
almost
shuddering
raskolnikov
noticed
this
disproportionate
terror
i
fancy
i
shall
have
to
see
him
more
than
once
again
he
said
to
dounia
we
will
watch
him
i
will
track
him
out
cried
razumihin
vigorously
i
won
t
lose
sight
of
him
rodya
ha
given
me
leave
he
said
to
me
himself
just
now
take
care
of
my
will
you
give
me
leave
too
avdotya
romanovna
dounia
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
but
the
look
of
anxiety
did
not
leave
her
face
pulcheria
alexandrovna
gazed
at
her
timidly
but
the
three
thousand
rouble
had
obviously
a
soothing
effect
on
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
were
all
engaged
in
a
lively
conversation
even
raskolnikov
listened
attentively
for
some
time
though
he
did
not
talk
razumihin
wa
the
speaker
and
why
why
should
you
go
away
he
flowed
on
ecstatically
and
what
are
you
to
do
in
a
little
town
the
great
thing
is
you
are
all
here
together
and
you
need
one
another
you
do
need
one
another
believe
me
for
a
time
anyway
take
me
into
partnership
and
i
assure
you
we
ll
plan
a
capital
enterprise
listen
i
ll
explain
it
all
in
detail
to
you
the
whole
project
it
all
flashed
into
my
head
this
morning
before
anything
had
happened
i
tell
you
what
i
have
an
uncle
i
must
introduce
him
to
you
a
most
accommodating
and
respectable
old
man
this
uncle
ha
got
a
capital
of
a
thousand
rouble
and
he
life
on
his
pension
and
ha
no
need
of
that
money
for
the
last
two
year
he
ha
been
bothering
me
to
borrow
it
from
him
and
pay
him
six
per
cent
interest
i
know
what
that
mean
he
simply
want
to
help
me
last
year
i
had
no
need
of
it
but
this
year
i
resolved
to
borrow
it
a
soon
a
he
arrived
then
you
lend
me
another
thousand
of
your
three
and
we
have
enough
for
a
start
so
we
ll
go
into
partnership
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
then
razumihin
began
to
unfold
his
project
and
he
explained
at
length
that
almost
all
our
publisher
and
bookseller
know
nothing
at
all
of
what
they
are
selling
and
for
that
reason
they
are
usually
bad
publisher
and
that
any
decent
publication
pay
a
a
rule
and
give
a
profit
sometimes
a
considerable
one
razumihin
had
indeed
been
dreaming
of
setting
up
a
a
publisher
for
the
last
two
year
he
had
been
working
in
publisher
office
and
knew
three
european
language
well
though
he
had
told
raskolnikov
six
day
before
that
he
wa
schwach
in
german
with
an
object
of
persuading
him
to
take
half
his
translation
and
half
the
payment
for
it
he
had
told
a
lie
then
and
raskolnikov
knew
he
wa
lying
why
why
should
we
let
our
chance
slip
when
we
have
one
of
the
chief
mean
of
success
money
of
our
own
cried
razumihin
warmly
of
course
there
will
be
a
lot
of
work
but
we
will
work
you
avdotya
romanovna
i
rodion
you
get
a
splendid
profit
on
some
book
nowadays
and
the
great
point
of
the
business
is
that
we
shall
know
just
what
want
translating
and
we
shall
be
translating
publishing
learning
all
at
once
i
can
be
of
use
because
i
have
experience
for
nearly
two
year
i
ve
been
scuttling
about
among
the
publisher
and
now
i
know
every
detail
of
their
business
you
need
not
be
a
saint
to
make
pot
believe
me
and
why
why
should
we
let
our
chance
slip
why
i
know
and
i
kept
the
secret
two
or
three
book
which
one
might
get
a
hundred
rouble
simply
for
thinking
of
translating
and
publishing
indeed
and
i
would
not
take
five
hundred
for
the
very
idea
of
one
of
them
and
what
do
you
think
if
i
were
to
tell
a
publisher
i
dare
say
he
d
hesitate
they
are
such
blockhead
and
a
for
the
business
side
printing
paper
selling
you
trust
to
me
i
know
my
way
about
we
ll
begin
in
a
small
way
and
go
on
to
a
large
in
any
case
it
will
get
u
our
living
and
we
shall
get
back
our
dounia
s
eye
shone
i
like
what
you
are
saying
dmitri
prokofitch
she
said
i
know
nothing
about
it
of
course
put
in
pulcheria
alexandrovna
it
may
be
a
good
idea
but
again
god
know
it
s
new
and
untried
of
course
we
must
remain
here
at
least
for
a
she
looked
at
rodya
what
do
you
think
brother
said
dounia
i
think
he
s
got
a
very
good
idea
he
answered
of
course
it
s
too
soon
to
dream
of
a
publishing
firm
but
we
certainly
might
bring
out
five
or
six
book
and
be
sure
of
success
i
know
of
one
book
myself
which
would
be
sure
to
go
well
and
a
for
his
being
able
to
manage
it
there
s
no
doubt
about
that
either
he
know
the
business
but
we
can
talk
it
over
later
hurrah
cried
razumihin
now
stay
there
s
a
flat
here
in
this
house
belonging
to
the
same
owner

i
ll
pawn
your
watch
and
bring
you
the
money
and
everything
can
be
arranged
then
you
can
all
three
live
together
and
rodya
will
be
with
you
but
where
are
you
off
to
rodya
what
rodya
you
are
going
already
pulcheria
alexandrovna
asked
in
dismay
at
such
a
minute
cried
razumihin
dounia
looked
at
her
brother
with
incredulous
wonder
he
held
his
cap
in
his
hand
he
wa
preparing
to
leave
them
one
would
think
you
were
burying
me
or
saying
for
ever
he
said
somewhat
oddly
he
attempted
to
smile
but
it
did
not
turn
out
a
smile
but
who
know
perhaps
it
is
the
last
time
we
shall
see
each
other
he
let
slip
accidentally
it
wa
what
he
wa
thinking
and
it
somehow
wa
uttered
aloud
what
is
the
matter
with
you
cried
his
mother
where
are
you
going
rodya
asked
dounia
rather
strangely
oh
i
m
quite
obliged
to
he
answered
vaguely
a
though
hesitating
what
he
would
say
but
there
wa
a
look
of
sharp
determination
in
his
white
face
i
meant
to
say
a
i
wa
coming
here
i
meant
to
tell
you
mother
and
you
dounia
that
it
would
be
better
for
u
to
part
for
a
time
i
feel
ill
i
am
not
at
peace
i

s
possible
i
remember
you
and
love
you
leave
me
leave
me
alone
i
decided
this
even
before
i
m
absolutely
resolved
on
it
whatever
may
come
to
me
whether
i
come
to
ruin
or
not
i
want
to
be
alone

me
altogether
it
s

inquire
about
me
when
i
can
i
ll
come
of
myself
or
i
ll
send
for
you

will
all
come
back
but
now
if
you

me
up

cried
pulcheria
alexandrovna
both
his
mother
and
his
sister
were
terribly
alarmed
razumihin
wa
also
rodya

reconciled
with
u
let
u
be
a
before
cried
his
poor
mother
he
turned
slowly
to
the
door
and
slowly
went
out
of
the
room
dounia
overtook
him
brother
what
are
you
doing
to
mother
she
whispered
her
eye
flashing
with
indignation
he
looked
dully
at
her
no
matter
i
shall
come
i
m
coming
he
muttered
in
an
undertone
a
though
not
fully
conscious
of
what
he
wa
saying
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
wicked
heartless
egoist
cried
dounia
he
is
insane
but
not
heartless
he
is
mad
don
t
you
see
it
you
re
heartless
after
that
razumihin
whispered
in
her
ear
squeezing
her
hand
tightly
i
shall
be
back
directly
he
shouted
to
the
mother
and
he
ran
out
of
the
room
raskolnikov
wa
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
passage
i
knew
you
would
run
after
me
he
said
go
back
to
them
be
with
them
be
with
them
and
always
i
perhaps
i
shall
come
if
i
can
and
without
holding
out
his
hand
he
walked
away
but
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
doing
what
s
the
matter
with
you
how
can
you
go
on
like
this
razumihin
muttered
at
his
wit
end
raskolnikov
stopped
once
more
once
for
all
never
ask
me
about
anything
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
don
t
come
to
see
me
maybe
i
ll
come
here
leave
me
but
t
them
do
you
understand
me
it
wa
dark
in
the
corridor
they
were
standing
near
the
lamp
for
a
minute
they
were
looking
at
one
another
in
silence
razumihin
remembered
that
minute
all
his
life
raskolnikov
s
burning
and
intent
eye
grew
more
penetrating
every
moment
piercing
into
his
soul
into
his
consciousness
suddenly
razumihin
started
something
strange
a
it
were
passed
between
them
some
idea
some
hint
a
it
were
slipped
something
awful
hideous
and
suddenly
understood
on
both
side
razumihin
turned
pale
do
you
understand
now
said
raskolnikov
his
face
twitching
nervously
go
back
go
to
them
he
said
suddenly
and
turning
quickly
he
went
out
of
the
house
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
how
razumihin
went
back
to
the
lady
how
he
soothed
them
how
he
protested
that
rodya
needed
rest
in
his
illness
protested
that
rodya
wa
sure
to
come
that
he
would
come
every
day
that
he
wa
very
very
much
upset
that
he
must
not
be
irritated
that
he
razumihin
would
watch
over
him
would
get
him
a
doctor
the
best
doctor
a
consultation
in
fact
from
that
evening
razumihin
took
his
place
with
them

and
a
brother
chapter
iv
raskolnikov
went
straight
to
the
house
on
the
canal
bank
where
sonia
lived
it
wa
an
old
green
house
of
three
storey
he
found
the
porter
and
obtained
from
him
vague
direction
a
to
the
whereabouts
of
kapernaumov
the
tailor
having
found
in
the
corner
of
the
courtyard
the
entrance
to
the
dark
and
narrow
staircase
he
mounted
to
the
second
floor
and
came
out
into
a
gallery
that
ran
round
the
whole
second
storey
over
the
yard
while
he
wa
wandering
in
the
darkness
uncertain
where
to
turn
for
kapernaumov
s
door
a
door
opened
three
pace
from
him
he
mechanically
took
hold
of
it
who
is
there
a
woman
s
voice
asked
uneasily
it
s
i
come
to
see
you
answered
raskolnikov
and
he
walked
into
the
tiny
entry
on
a
broken
chair
stood
a
candle
in
a
battered
copper
candlestick
it
s
you
good
heaven
cried
sonia
weakly
and
she
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
which
is
your
room
this
way
and
raskolnikov
trying
not
to
look
at
her
hastened
in
a
minute
later
sonia
too
came
in
with
the
candle
set
down
the
candlestick
and
completely
disconcerted
stood
before
him
inexpressibly
agitated
and
apparently
frightened
by
his
unexpected
visit
the
colour
rushed
suddenly
to
her
pale
face
and
tear
came
into
her
eye
she
felt
sick
and
ashamed
and
happy
too
raskolnikov
turned
away
quickly
and
sat
on
a
chair
by
the
table
he
scanned
the
room
in
a
rapid
glance
it
wa
a
large
but
exceedingly
room
the
only
one
let
by
the
kapernaumovs
to
whose
room

closed
door
led
in

locked

led
to
the
next
flat
which
formed
a
separate
lodging
sonia
s
room
looked
like
a
barn
it
wa
a
very
irregular
quadrangle
and
this
gave
it
a
grotesque
appearance
a
wall
with
three

looking
out
on
to
the
canal
ran
aslant
so
that
one
corner
formed
a
very
acute
angle
and
it
wa
difficult
to
see
in
it
without
very
strong
light
the
other
corner
wa
disproportionately
obtuse
there
wa

in

desert
that
wa
all
there

in
the
room

yellow
scratched
and
shabby
wa
black
in

corner

have
been
damp
and
full
of
fume
in
the
winter
there
wa
every
sign
of
poverty
even
the
bedstead
had
no
curtain
sonia
looked
in
silence
at
her
visitor
who
wa
so
attentively
and
unceremoniously
scrutinising
her
room
and
even
began
at
last
to
tremble
with
terror
a
though
she
wa
standing
before
her
judge
and
the
arbiter
of
her
destiny
i
am
late
it
s
eleven
isn
t
it
he
asked
still
not
lifting
his
eye
yes
muttered
sonia
oh
yes
it
is
she
added
hastily
a
though
in
that
lay
her
mean
of
escape
my
landlady
s
clock
ha
just
struck
i
heard
it
myself
i

the
last
time
raskolnikov

on
gloomily
although
this
wa
the
first
time
i
may
perhaps
not
see
you
again

you
going
away

don
t

not

s
voice
shook
i
don
t
know
i
shall
know
morning
never
mind
that
i
ve
come
to
say
one
word
he
raised
his
brooding
eye
to
her
and
suddenly
noticed
that
he
wa
sitting
down
while
she
wa
all
the
while
standing
before
him
why
are
you
standing
sit
down
he
said
in
a
changed
voice
gentle
and
friendly
she
sat
down
he
looked
kindly
and
almost
compassionately
at
her
how
thin
you
are
what
a
hand
quite
transparent
like
a
dead
he
took
her
hand
sonia
smiled
faintly
i
have
always
been
like
that
she
said
even
when
you
lived
at
home
of
course
you
were
he
added
abruptly
and
the
expression
of
his
face
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
changed
again
suddenly
he
looked
round
him
once
more
you
rent
this
room
from
the
kapernaumovs
yes
they
live
there
through
that
door
yes
they
have
another
room
like
all
in
one
room
i
should
be
afraid
in
your
room
at
night
he
observed
gloomily
they
are
very
good
people
very
kind
answered
sonia
who
still
seemed
bewildered
and
all
the
furniture
everything
everything
is
theirs
and
they
are
very
kind
and
the
child
too
often
come
to
see
they
all
stammer
don
t
they
yes
he
stammer
and
he
s
lame
and
his
wife
too
it
s
not
exactly
that
she
stammer
but
she
can
t
speak
plainly
she
is
a
very
kind
woman
and
he
used
to
be
a
house
serf
and
there
are
seven
child
and
it
s
only
the
eldest
one
that
stammer
and
the
others
are
simply
ill
but
they
don
t
stammer
but
where
did
you
hear
about
them
she
added
with
some
surprise
your
father
told
me
then
he
told
me
all
about
you
and
how
you
went
out
at
six
o
clock
and
came
back
at
nine
and
how
katerina
ivanovna
knelt
down
by
your
sonia
wa
confused
i
fancied
i
saw
him
she
whispered
hesitatingly
whom
father
i
wa
walking
in
the
street
out
there
at
the
corner
about
ten
o
clock
and
he
seemed
to
be
walking
in
front
it
looked
just
like
him
i
wanted
to
go
to
katerina
ivanovna
you
were
walking
in
the
street
yes
sonia
whispered
abruptly
again
overcome
with
confusion
and
looking
down
katerina
ivanovna
used
to
beat
you
i
dare
say
oh
no
what
are
you
saying
no
sonia
looked
at
him
almost
with
dismay
you
love
her
then
love
her
of
course
said
sonia
with
plaintive
emphasis
and
she
clasped
her
hand
in
distress
ah
you
don
t
if
you
only
knew
you
see
she
is
quite
like
a
child
her
mind
is
quite
unhinged
you
see
from
sorrow
and
how
clever
she
used
to
be
how
generous
how
kind
ah
you
don
t
understand
you
don
t
understand
sonia
said
this
a
though
in
despair
wringing
her
hand
in
excitement
and
distress
her
pale
cheek
flushed
there
wa
a
look
of
anguish
in
her
eye
it
wa
clear
that
she
wa
stirred
to
the
very
depth
that
she
wa
longing
to
speak
to
champion
to
express
something
a
sort
of
compassion
if
one
may
so
express
it
wa
reflected
in
every
feature
of
her
face
beat
me
how
can
you
good
heaven
beat
me
and
if
she
did
beat
me
what
then
what
of
it
you
know
nothing
nothing
about
it
she
is
so
unhappy
ah
how
unhappy
and
ill
she
is
seeking
righteousness
she
is
pure
she
ha
such
faith
that
there
must
be
righteousness
everywhere
and
she
expects
it
and
if
you
were
to
torture
her
she
wouldn
t
do
wrong
she
doesn
t
see
that
it
s
impossible
for
people
to
be
righteous
and
she
is
angry
at
it
like
a
child
like
a
child
she
is
good
and
what
will
happen
to
you
sonia
looked
at
him
inquiringly
they
are
left
on
your
hand
you
see
they
were
all
on
your
hand
before
though
and
your
father
came
to
you
to
beg
for
drink
well
how
will
it
be
now
i
don
t
know
sonia
articulated
mournfully
will
they
stay
there
i
don
t
know
they
are
in
debt
for
the
lodging
but
the
landlady
i
hear
said
that
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
them
and
katerina
ivanovna
say
that
she
won
t
stay
another
how
is
it
she
is
so
bold
she
relies
upon
you
oh
no
don
t
talk
like
that
we
are
one
we
live
like
sonia
wa
agitated
again
and
even
angry
a
though
a
canary
or
some
other
little
bird
were
to
be
angry
and
what
could
she
do
what
what
could
she
do
she
persisted
getting
hot
and
excited
and
how
she
cried
her
mind
is
unhinged
haven
t
you
noticed
it
at
one
minute
she
is
worrying
like
a
child
that
everything
should
be
right
the
lunch
and
all
that
then
she
is
wringing
her
hand
spitting
blood
weeping
and
all
at
once
she
will
begin
knocking
her
head
against
the
wall
in
despair
then
she
will
be
comforted
again
she
build
all
her
hope
on
you
she
say
that
you
will
help
her
now
and
that
she
will
borrow
a
little
money
somewhere
and
go
to
her
native
town
with
me
and
set
up
a
boarding
school
for
the
daughter
of
gentleman
and
take
me
to
superintend
it
and
we
will
begin
a
new
splendid
life
and
she
kiss
and
hug
me
comfort
me
and
you
know
she
ha
such
faith
such
faith
in
her
fancy
one
can
t
contradict
her
and
all
the
day
long
she
ha
been
washing
cleaning
mending
she
dragged
the
wash
tub
into
the
room
with
her
feeble
hand
and
sank
on
the
bed
gasping
for
breath
we
went
this
morning
to
the
shop
to
buy
shoe
for
polenka
and
lida
for
theirs

quite
worn
out

the
money

t
enough

enough
and
she
picked
out
such
dear
little
boot
for
she
ha
taste
you
don
t
know
and
there
in
the
shop
she
burst
out
cry
before
the
shopmen
because
she
hadn
t
enough
ah

sad
to

her
well
after

raskolnikov

a
bitter
smile
and

sonia
flew
at
him
again
why

your
last
penny

thought
of

a
she
spoke
at
the
pain
of

at

in
the
glass
and
wa
delighted
with
them

me
a
present
of
them
sonia
she
said

she
said
she
wanted
them
so
much
and
when
could
she
wear
them
they
just
reminded
her
of
her
old
happy
day
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
admired
herself
and
she
ha
no
clothes
at
all
no
thing
of
her
own
hasn
t
had
all
these

and
she
never
asks
anyone
for
anything
she
is
proud
she
d
sooner
give
away
everything
and
these
she
asked
for
she
liked
them
so
much
and
i
wa
sorry
to
give
them
what
use
are
they
to
you
katerina
ivanovna
i
said
i
spoke
like
that
to
her
i
ought
not
to
have
said
that
she
gave
me
such
a
look
and
she
wa
so
grieved
so
grieved
at
my
refusing
her
and
it
wa
so
sad
to
see
and
she
wa
not
grieved
for
the
collar
but
for
my
refusing
i
saw
that
ah
if
only
i
could
bring
it
all
back
change
it
take
back
those
word
ah

but

nothing
to
you
did
you
know
lizaveta
the
pedlar
yes
did
you
know
her
sonia
asked
with
some
surprise
katerina
ivanovna
is
in
consumption
rapid
consumption
she
will
soon
die
said
raskolnikov
after
a
pause
without
answering
her
question
oh
no
no
no
and
sonia
unconsciously
clutched
both
his
hand
a
though
imploring
that
she
should
not
but
it
will
be
better
if
she
doe
no
not
better
not
at
all
better
sonia
unconsciously
repeated
in
dismay
and
the
child
what
can
you
do
except
take
them
to
live
with
you
oh
i
don
t
know
cried
sonia
almost
in
despair
and
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
it
wa
evident
that
that
idea
had
very
often
occurred
to
her
before
and
he
had
only
roused
it
again
and
what
if
even
now
while
katerina
ivanovna
is
alive
you
get
ill
and
are
taken
to
the
hospital
what
will
happen
then
he
persisted
pitilessly
how
can
you
that
can
not
be
and
sonia
s
face
worked
with
awful
terror
can
not
be
raskolnikov
went
on
with
a
harsh
smile
you
are
not
insured
against
it
are
you
what
will
happen
to
them
then
they
will
be
in
the
street
all
of
them
she
will
cough
and
beg
and
knock
her
head
against
some
wall
a
she
did
and
the
child
will
cry
then
she
will
fall
down
be
taken
to
the
police
station
and
to
the
hospital
she
will
die
and
the
child
oh
no
god
will
not
let
it
be
broke
at
last
from
sonia
s
overburdened
bosom
she
listened
looking
imploringly
at
him
clasping
her
hand
in
dumb
entreaty
a
though
it
all
depended
upon
him
raskolnikov
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
a
minute
passed
sonia
wa
standing
with
her
hand
and
her
head
hanging
in
terrible
dejection
and
can
t
you
save
put
by
for
a
rainy
day
he
asked
stopping
suddenly
before
her
no
whispered
sonia
of
course
not
have
you
tried
he
added
almost
ironically
and
it
didn
t
come
off
of
course
not
no
need
to
and
again
he
paced
the
room
another
minute
passed
you
don
t
get
money
every
day
sonia
wa
more
confused
than
ever
and
colour
rushed
into
her
face
again
no
she
whispered
with
a
painful
effort
it
will
be
the
same
with
polenka
no
doubt
he
said
suddenly
no
no
it
can
t
be
no
sonia
cried
aloud
in
desperation
a
though

god

not
allow
anything
so
awful
he
let
others
come
to
no
no
god
will
protect
her
god
she
repeated
beside
herself
but
perhaps
there
is
no
god
at
all
raskolnikov
answered
with
a
sort
of
malignance
laughed
and
looked
at
her
sonia
s
face
suddenly
changed
a
tremor
passed
over
it
she
looked
at
him
with
unutterable
reproach
tried
to
say
something
but
could
not
speak
and
broke
into
bitter
bitter
sob
hiding
her
face
in
her
hand
you
say
katerina
ivanovna
s
mind
is
unhinged
your
own
mind
is
unhinged
he
said
after
a
brief
silence
five
minute
passed
he
still
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence
not
looking
at
her
at
last
he
went
up
to
her
his
eye
glittered
he
put
his
two
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
looked
straight
into
her
tearful
face
his
eye
were
hard
feverish
and
piercing
his
lip
were
twitching
all
at
once
he
bent
down
quickly
and
dropping
to
the
ground
kissed
her
foot
sonia
drew
back
from
him
a
from
a
madman
and
certainly
he
looked
like
a
madman
what
are
you
doing
to
me
she
muttered
turning
pale
and
a
sudden
anguish
clutched
at
her
heart
he
stood
up
at
once
i
did
not
bow
down
to
you
i
bowed
down
to
all
the
suffering
of
humanity
he
said
wildly
and
walked
away
to
the
window
listen
he
added
turning
to
her
a
minute
later
i
said
just
now
to
an
insolent
man
that
he
wa
not
worth
your
little
finger
and
that
i
did
my
sister
honour
making
her
sit
beside
ach
you
said
that
to
them
and
in
her
presence
cried
sonia
frightened
sit
down
with
me
an
honour
why
i
m
dishonourable
ah
why
did
you
say
that
it
wa
not
because
of
your
dishonour
and
your
sin
i
said
that
of
you
but
because
of
your
great
suffering
but
you
are
a
great
sinner
that
s
true
he
added
almost
solemnly
and
your
worst
sin
is
that
you
have
destroyed
and
betrayed
yourself
isn
t
that
fearful
isn
t
it
fearful
that
you
are
living
in
this
filth
which
you
loathe
so
and
at
the
same
time
you
know
yourself
you
ve
only
to
open
your
eye
that
you
are
not
helping
anyone
by
it
not
saving
anyone
from
anything
tell
me
he
went
on
almost
in
a
frenzy
how
this
shame
and
degradation
can
exist
in
you
side
by
side
with
other
opposite
holy
feeling
it
would
be
better
a
thousand
time
better
and
wiser
to
leap
into
the
water
and
end
it
all
but
what
would
become
of
them
sonia
asked
faintly
gazing
at
him
with
eye
of
anguish
but
not
seeming
surprised
at
his
suggestion
raskolnikov
looked
strangely
at
her
he
read
it
all
in
her
face
so
she
must
have
had
that
thought
already
perhaps
many
time
and
earnestly
she
had
thought
out
in
her
despair
how
to
end
it
and
so
earnestly
that
now
she
scarcely
wondered
at
his
suggestion
she
had
not
even
noticed
the
cruelty
of
his
word
the
significance
of
his
reproach
and
his
peculiar
attitude
to
her
shame
she
had
of
course
not
noticed
either
and
that
too
wa
clear
to
him
but
he
saw
how
monstrously
the
thought
of
her
disgraceful
shameful
position
wa
torturing
her
and
had
long
tortured
her
what
what
he
thought
could
hitherto
have
hindered
her
from
putting
an
end
to
it
only
then
he
realised
what
those
poor
little
orphan
child
and
that
pitiful
katerina
ivanovna
knocking
her
head
against
the
wall
in
her
consumption
meant
for
sonia
but
nevertheless
it
wa
clear
to
him
again
that
with
her
character
and
the
amount
of
education
she
had
after
all
received
she
could
not
in
any
case
remain
so
he
wa
still
confronted
by
the
question
how
could
she
have
remained
so
long
in
that
position
without
going
out
of
her
mind
since
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
jump
into
the
water
of
course
he
knew
that
sonia
s
position
wa
an
exceptional
case
though
unhappily
not
unique
and
not
infrequent
indeed
but
that
very
exceptionalness
her
tinge
of
education
her
previous
life
might
one
would
have
thought
have
killed
her
at
the
first
step
on
that
revolting
path
what
held
her
up
surely
not
depravity
all
that
infamy
had
obviously
only
touched
her
mechanically
not
one
drop
of
real
depravity
had
penetrated
to
her
heart
he
saw
that
he
saw
through
her
a
she
stood
before
him
there
are
three
way
before
her
he
thought
the
canal
the
madhouse
or
at
last
to
sink
into
depravity
which
obscures
the
mind
and
turn
the
heart
to
the
last
idea
wa
the
most
revolting
but
he
wa
a
sceptic
he
wa
young
abstract
and
therefore
cruel
and
so
he
could
not
help
believing
that
the
last
end
wa
the
most
likely
but
can
that
be
true
he
cried
to
himself
can
that
creature
who
ha
still
preserved
the
purity
of
her
spirit
be
consciously
drawn
at
last
into
that
sink
of
filth
and
iniquity
can
the
process
already
have
begun
can
it
be
that
she
ha
only
been
able
to
bear
it
till
now
because
vice
ha
begun
to
be
less
loathsome
to
her
no
no
that
can
not
be
he
cried
a
sonia
had
just
before
no
what
ha
kept
her
from
the
canal
till
now
is
the
idea
of
sin
and
they
the
child
and
if
she
ha
not
gone
out
of
her
mind
but
who
say
she
ha
not
gone
out
of
her
mind
is
she
in
her
sens
can
one
talk
can
one
reason
a
she
doe
how
can
she
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
abyss
of
loathsomeness
into
which
she
is
slipping
and
refuse
to
listen
when
she
is
told
of
danger
doe
she
expect
a
miracle
no
doubt
she
doe
doesn
t
that
all
mean
madness
he
stayed
obstinately
at
that
thought
he
liked
that
explanation
indeed
better
than
any
other
he
began
looking
more
intently
at
her
so
you
pray
to
god
a
great
deal
sonia
he
asked
her
sonia
did
not
speak
he
stood
beside
her
waiting
for
an
answer
what
should
i
be
without
god
she
whispered
rapidly
forcibly
glancing
at
him
with
suddenly
flashing
eye
and
squeezing
his
hand
ah
so
that
is
it
he
thought
and
what
doe
god
do
for
you
he
asked
probing
her
further
sonia
wa
silent
a
long
while
a
though
she
could
not
answer
her
weak
chest
kept
heaving
with
emotion
be
silent
don
t
ask
you
don
t
deserve
she
cried
suddenly
looking
sternly
and
wrathfully
at
him
that
s
it
that
s
it
he
repeated
to
himself
he
doe
everything
she
whispered
quickly
looking
down
again
that
s
the
way
out
that
s
the
explanation
he
decided
scrutinising
her
with
eager
curiosity
with
a
new
strange
almost
morbid
feeling
he
gazed
at
that
pale
thin
irregular
angular
little
face
those
soft
blue
eye
which
could
flash
with
such
fire
such
stern
energy
that
little
body
still
shaking
with
indignation
and
anger
and
it
all
seemed
to
him
more
and
more
strange
almost
impossible
she
is
a
religious
maniac
he
repeated
to
himself
there
wa
a
book
lying
on
the
chest
of
drawer
he
had
noticed
it
every
time
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
now
he
took
it
up
and
looked
at
it
it
wa
the
new
testament
in
the
russian
translation
it
wa
bound
in
leather
old
and
worn
where
did
you
get
that
he
called
to
her
across
the
room
she
wa
still
standing
in
the
same
place
three
step
from
the
table
it
wa
brought
me
she
answered
a
it
were
unwillingly
not
looking
at
him
who
brought
it
lizaveta
i
asked
her
for
lizaveta
strange
he
thought
everything
about
sonia
seemed
to
him
stranger
and
more
wonderful
every
moment
he
carried
the
book
to
the
candle
and
began
to
turn
over
the
page
where
is
the
story
of
lazarus
he
asked
suddenly
sonia
looked
obstinately
at
the
ground
and
would
not
answer
she
wa
standing
sideways
to
the
table
where
is
the
raising
of
lazarus
find
it
for
me
she
stole
a
glance
at
him
you
are
not
looking
in
the
right
place
it
s
in
the
fourth
gospel
she
whispered
sternly
without
looking
at
him
find
it
and
read
it
to
me
he
said
he
sat
down
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
looked
away
sullenly
prepared
to
listen
in
three
week
time
they
ll
welcome
me
in
the
madhouse
i
shall
be
there
if
i
am
not
in
a
worse
place
he
muttered
to
himself
sonia
heard
raskolnikov
s
request
distrustfully
and
moved
hesitatingly
to
the
table
she
took
the
book
however
haven
t
you
read
it
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
across
the
table
her
voice
became
sterner
and
sterner
long
ago
when
i
wa
at
school
read
and
haven
t
you
heard
it
in
church
i
haven
t
been
do
you
often
go
whispered
sonia
raskolnikov
smiled
i
understand
and
you
won
t
go
to
your
father
s
funeral
yes
i
shall
i
wa
at
church
last
week
too
i
had
a
requiem
for
whom
for
lizaveta
she
wa
killed
with
an
his
nerve
were
more
and
more
strained
his
head
began
to
go
round
were
you
friend
with
lizaveta
yes
she
wa
good
she
used
to
come
not
often
she
couldn
t
we
used
to
read
together
and
talk
she
will
see
the
last
phrase
sounded
strange
in
his
ear
and
here
wa
something
new
again
the
mysterious
meeting
with
lizaveta
and
both
of
them
religious
maniac
i
shall
be
a
religious
maniac
myself
soon
it
s
infectious
read
he
cried
irritably
and
insistently
sonia
still
hesitated
her
heart
wa
throbbing
she
hardly
dared
to
read
to
him
he
looked
almost
with
exasperation
at
the
unhappy
what
for
you
don
t
believe
she
whispered
softly
and
a
it
were
breathlessly
read
i
want
you
to
he
persisted
you
used
to
read
to
sonia
opened
the
book
and
found
the
place
her
hand
were
shaking
her
voice
failed
her
twice
she
tried
to
begin
and
could
not
bring
out
the
first
syllable
now
a
certain
man
wa
sick
named
lazarus
of
bethany
she
forced
herself
at
last
to
read
but
at
the
third
word
her
voice
broke
like
an
overstrained
string
there
wa
a
catch
in
her
breath
raskolnikov
saw
in
part
why
sonia
could
not
bring
herself
to
read
to
him
and
the
more
he
saw
this
the
more
roughly
and
irritably
he
insisted
on
her
doing
so
he
understood
only
too
well
how
painful
it
wa
for
her
to
betray
and
unveil
all
that
wa
her
he
understood
that
these
feeling
really
were
her
which
she
had
kept
perhaps
for
year
perhaps
from
childhood
while
she
lived
with
an
unhappy
father
and
a
distracted
stepmother
crazed
by
grief
in
the
midst
of
starving
child
and
unseemly
abuse
and
reproach
but
at
the
same
time
he
knew
now
and
knew
for
certain
that
although
it
filled
her
with
dread
and
suffering
yet
she
had
a
tormenting
desire
to
read
and
to
read
to
that
he
might
hear
it
and
to
read
whatever
might
come
of
it
he
read
this
in
her
eye
he
could
see
it
in
her
intense
emotion
she
mastered
herself
controlled
the
spasm
in
her
throat
and
went
on
reading
the
eleventh
chapter
of
john
she
went
on
to
the
nineteenth
verse
and
many
of
the
jew
came
to
martha
and
mary
to
comfort
them
concerning
their
brother
then
martha
a
soon
a
she
heard
that
jesus
wa
coming
went
and
met
him
but
mary
sat
still
in
the
house
then
said
martha
unto
jesus
lord
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
but
i
know
that
even
now
whatsoever
thou
wilt
ask
of
god
god
will
give
it
thee
then
she
stopped
again
with
a
shamefaced
feeling
that
her
voice
would
quiver
and
break
again
jesus
said
unto

at
the

this
she
saith
unto
him
and
drawing
a
painful
breath
sonia
read
distinctly
and
forcibly
a
though
she
were
making
a
public
confession
of
faith
yea
lord
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
god
which
should
come
into
the
she
stopped
and
looked
up
quickly
at
him
but
controlling
herself
went
on
reading
raskolnikov
sat
without
moving
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
eye
turned
away
she
read
to
the
verse
then
when
mary
wa
come
where
jesus
wa
and
saw
him
she
fell
down
at
his
foot
saying
unto
him
lord
if
thou
hadst
been
here
my
brother
had
not
died
when
jesus
therefore
saw
her
weeping
and
the
jew
also
weeping
which
came
with
her
he
groaned
in
the
spirit
and
wa
troubled
and
said
where
have
ye
laid
him
they
said
unto
him
lord
come
and
see
jesus
wept
then
said
the
jew
behold
how
he
loved
him
and
some
of
them
said
could
not
this
man
which
opened
the
eye
of
the
blind
have
caused
that
even
this
man
should
not
have
died
raskolnikov
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
emotion
yes
he
had
known
it
she
wa
trembling
in
a
real
physical
fever
he
had
expected
it
she
wa
getting
near
the
story
of
the
greatest
miracle
and
a
feeling
of
immense
triumph
came
over
her
her
voice
rang
out
like
a
bell
triumph
and
joy
gave
it
power
the
line
danced
before
her
eye
but
she
knew
what
she
wa
reading
by
heart
at
the
last
verse
could
not
this
man
which
opened
the
eye
of
the
blind
dropping
her
voice
she
passionately
reproduced
the
doubt
the
reproach
and
censure
of
the
blind
disbelieving
jew
who
in
another
moment
would
fall
at
his
foot
a
though
struck
by
thunder
sobbing
and
believing
and
too
is
blinded
and
unbelieving
he
too
will
hear
he
too
will
believe
yes
yes
at
once
now
wa
what
she
wa
dreaming
and
she
wa
quivering
with
happy
anticipation
jesus
therefore
again
groaning
in
himself
cometh
to
the
grave
it
wa
a
cave
and
a
stone
lay
upon
it
jesus
said
take
ye
away
the
stone
martha
the
sister
of
him
that
wa
dead
saith
unto
him
lord
by
this
time
he
stinketh
for
he
hath
been
dead
four
she
laid
emphasis
on
the
word
jesus
saith
unto
her
said
i
not
unto
thee
that
if
thou
wouldest
believe
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
god
then
they
took
away
the
stone
from
the
place
where
the
dead
wa
laid
and
jesus
lifted
up
his
eye
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
heard
me
and
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
people
which
stand
by
i
said
it
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
hast
sent
me
and
when
he
thus
had
spoken
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
lazarus
come
forth
and
he
that
wa
dead
came
she
read
loudly
cold
and
trembling
with
ecstasy
a
though
she
were
seeing
it
before
her
eye
bound
hand
and
foot
with
graveclothes
and
his
face
wa
bound
about
with
a
napkin
jesus
saith
unto
them
loose
him
and
let
him
go
then
many
of
the
jew
which
came
to
mary
and
had
seen
the
thing
which
jesus
did
believed
on

could
read
no
more
closed
the
book
and
got
up
from
her
chair
quickly
that
is
all
about
the
raising
of
lazarus
she
whispered
severely
and
abruptly
and
turning
away
she
stood
motionless
not
daring
to
raise
her
eye
to
him
she
still
trembled
feverishly
the
wa
flickering
out
in
the
battered
candlestick
dimly
lighting
up
in
the
room
the
murderer
and
the
harlot
who
had
so
strangely
been
reading
together
the
eternal
book
five
minute
or
more
passed
i
came
to
speak
of
something
raskolnikov
said
aloud
frowning
he
got
up
and
went
to
sonia
she
lifted
her
eye
to
him
in
silence
his
face
wa
particularly
stern
and
there
wa
a
sort
of
savage
determination
in
it
i
have
abandoned
my
family
he
said
my
mother
and
sister
i
am
not
going
to
see
them
i
ve
broken
with
them
what
for
asked
sonia
amazed
her
recent
meeting
with
his
mother
and
sister
had
left
a
great
impression
which
she
could
not
analyse
she
heard
his
news
almost
with
horror
i
have
only
you
now
he
added
let

go
together

ve
come
to

accursed

u

our
way
together
his
eye
glittered
a
though
he
were
mad
sonia
thought
in
her
turn
go
where
she
asked
in
alarm
and
she
involuntarily
stepped
back
how
do
i
know
i
only
know
it
s
the
same
road
i
know
that
and
nothing
more
it
s
the
same
goal
she
looked
at
him
and
understood
nothing
she
knew
only
that
he
wa
terribly
infinitely
unhappy
no
one
of
them
will
understand
if
you
tell
them
but
i
have
understood
i
need

said
sonia
strangely
and
violently
agitated
by
his
word
what
for
because
you
can
t
remain
like
this
that
s
why
you
must
look
thing
straight
in
the
face
at
last
and
not
weep
like
a
child
and
cry
that
god
won
t
allow
it
what
will
happen
if
you
should
really
be
taken
to

what

sonia
weeping
hysterically
and
wringing
her
hand

to
be
done
break
what
must
be
broken
once
for

and
some
day
later
on

perhaps
what
they
meant
if
i
come
i
ll
tell
you
who
killed
lizaveta
sonia
started
with
terror
why
do
you
know
who
killed
her
she
asked
chilled
with
horror
looking
wildly
at
him
i
know
and
will
tell
you
only
you
i
have
chosen
you
out
i
m
not
coming
to
you
to
ask
forgiveness
but
simply
to
tell
you
i
chose
you
out
long
ago
to
hear
this
when
your
father
talked
of
you
and
when
lizaveta
wa
alive
i
thought
of
it
don
t
shake
hand
he
went
out
sonia
gazed
at
him
a
at
a
madman
but
she
herself
wa
like
one
insane
and
felt
it
her
head
wa
going
round
good
heaven
how
doe
he
know
who
killed
lizaveta
what
did
those
word
mean
it
s
awful
but
at
the
same
time
did
not
enter
her
head
not
for
a
moment
oh
he
must
be
terribly
unhappy
he
ha
abandoned
his
mother
and
sister
what
for
what
ha
happened
and
what
had
he
in
his
mind
what
did
he
say
to
her
he
had
kissed
her
foot
and
said
said
yes
he
had
said
it
clearly
that
he
could
not
live
without
her
oh
merciful
heaven
sonia
spent
the
whole
night
feverish
and
delirious
she
jumped
up
from
time
to
time
wept
and
wrung
her
hand
then
sank
again
into
feverish
sleep
and
dreamt
of
polenka
katerina
ivanovna
and
lizaveta
of
reading
the
gospel
and
him
him
with
pale
face
with
burning
eye
kissing
her
foot
weeping
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
on
the
right
which
divided
sonia
s
room
from
madame
resslich
s
flat
wa
a
room
which
had
long
stood
empty
a
card
wa
fixed
on
the
gate
and
a
notice
stuck
in
the
window
over
the
canal
advertising
it
to
let
sonia
had
long
been
accustomed
to
the
room
s
being
uninhabited
but
all
that
time
svidrigaïlov
had
been
standing
listening
at
the
door
of
the
empty
room
when
raskolnikov
went
out
he
stood
still
thought
a
moment
went
on
tiptoe
to
his
own
room
which
adjoined
the
empty
one
brought
a
chair
and
noiselessly
carried
it
to
the
door
that
led
to
sonia
s
room
the
conversation
had
struck
him
a
interesting
and
remarkable
and
he
had
greatly
enjoyed
it
so
much
so
that
he
brought
a
chair
that
he
might
not
in
the
future
for
instance
have
to
endure
the
inconvenience
of
standing
a
whole
hour
but
might
listen
in
comfort
chapter
v
when
next
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
punctually
raskolnikov
went
into
the
department
of
the
investigation
of
criminal
cause
and
sent
his
name
in
to
porfiry
petrovitch
he
wa
surprised
at
being
kept
waiting
so
long
it
wa
at
least
ten
minute
before
he
wa
summoned
he
had
expected
that
they
would
pounce
upon
him
but
he
stood
in
the
and
people
who
apparently
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
were
continually
passing
to
and
fro
before
him
in
the
next
room
which
looked
like
an
office
several
clerk
were
sitting
writing
and
obviously
they
had
no
notion
who
or
what
raskolnikov
might
be
he
looked
uneasily
and
suspiciously
about
him
to
see
whether
there
wa
not
some
guard
some
mysterious
watch
being
kept
on
him
to
prevent
his
escape
but
there
wa
nothing
of
the
sort
he
saw
only
the
face
of
clerk
absorbed
in
petty
detail
then
other
people
no
one
seemed
to
have
any
concern
with
him
he
might
go
where
he
liked
for
them
the
conviction
grew
stronger
in
him
that
if
that
enigmatic
man
of
yesterday
that
phantom
sprung
out
of
the
earth
had
seen
everything
they
would
not
have
let
him
stand
and
wait
like
that
and
would
they
have
waited
till
he
elected
to
appear
at
eleven
either
the
man
had
not
yet
given
information
or
or
simply
he
knew
nothing
had
seen
nothing
and
how
could
he
have
seen
anything
and
so
all
that
had
happened
to
him
the
day
before
wa
again
a
phantom
exaggerated
by
his
sick
and
overstrained
imagination
this
conjecture
had
begun
to
grow
strong
the
day
before
in
the
midst
of
all
his
alarm
and
despair
thinking
it
all
over
now
and
preparing
for
a
fresh
conflict
he
wa
suddenly
aware
that
he
wa
trembling
and
he
felt
a
rush
of
indignation
at
the
thought
that
he
wa
trembling
with
fear
at
facing
that
hateful
porfiry
petrovitch
what
he
dreaded
above
all
wa
meeting
that
man
again
he
hated
him
with
an
intense
unmitigated
hatred
and
wa
afraid
his
hatred
might
betray
him
his
indignation
wa
such
that
he
ceased
trembling
at
once
he
made
ready
to
go
in
with
a
cold
and
arrogant
bearing
and
vowed
to
himself
to
keep
a
silent
a
possible
to
watch
and
listen
and
for
once
at
least
to
control
his
overstrained
nerve
at
that
moment
he
wa
summoned
to
porfiry
petrovitch
he
found
porfiry
petrovitch
alone
in
his
study
his
study
wa
a
room
neither
large
nor
small
furnished
with
a
large
that
stood
before
a
sofa
upholstered
in
checked
material
a
bureau
a
bookcase
in
the
corner
and
several
chair
all
government
furniture
of
polished
yellow
wood
in
the
further
wall
there
wa
a
closed
door
beyond
it
there
were
no
doubt
other
room
on
raskolnikov
s
entrance
porfiry
petrovitch
had
at
once
closed
the
door
by
which
he
had
come
in
and
they
remained
alone
he
met
his
visitor
with
an
apparently
genial
and
air
and
it
wa
only
after
a
few
minute
that
raskolnikov
saw
sign
of
a
certain
awkwardness
in
him
a
though
he
had
been
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
or
caught
in
something
very
secret
ah
my
dear
fellow
here
you
are
in
our
domain
began
porfiry
holding
out
both
hand
to
him
come
sit
down
old
man
or
perhaps
you
don
t
like
to
be
called
my
dear
fellow
and
old
man
please
don
t
think
it
too
familiar
here
on
the
raskolnikov
sat
down
keeping
his
eye
fixed
on
him
in
our
domain
the
apology
for
familiarity
the
french
phrase
were
all
characteristic
sign
he
held
out
both
hand
to
me
but
he
did
not
give
me
one
he
drew
it
back
in
time
struck
him
suspiciously
both
were
watching
each
other
but
when
their
eye
met
quick
a
lightning
they
looked
away
i
brought
you
this
paper
about
the
watch
here
it
is
is
it
all
right
or
shall
i
copy
it
again
what
a
paper
yes
yes
don
t
be
uneasy
it
s
all
right
porfiry
petrovitch
said
a
though
in
haste
and
after
he
had
said
it
he
took
the
paper
and
looked
at
it
yes
it
s
all
right
nothing
more
is
needed
he
declared
with
the
same
rapidity
and
he
laid
the
paper
on
the
table
a
minute
later
when
he
wa
talking
of
something
else
he
took
it
from
the
table
and
put
it
on
his
bureau
i
believe
you
said
yesterday
you
would
like
to
question
me
formally
about
my
acquaintance
with
the
murdered
woman
raskolnikov
wa
beginning
again
why
did
i
put
in
i
believe
passed
through
his
mind
in
a
flash
why
am
i
so
uneasy
at
having
put
in
that
came
in
a
second
flash
and
he
suddenly
felt
that
his
uneasiness
at
the
mere
contact
with
porfiry
at
the
first
word
at
the
first
look
had
grown
in
an
instant
to
monstrous
proportion
and
that
this
wa
fearfully
dangerous
his
nerve
were
quivering
his
emotion
wa
increasing
it
s
bad
it
s
bad
i
shall
say
too
much
yes
yes
yes
there
s
no
hurry
there
s
no
hurry
muttered
porfiry
petrovitch
moving
to
and
fro
about
the
table
without
any
apparent
aim
a
it
were
making
dash
towards
the
window
the
bureau
and
the
table
at
one
moment
avoiding
raskolnikov
s
suspicious
glance
then
again
standing
still
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
his
fat
round
little
figure
looked
very
strange
like
a
ball
rolling
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
rebounding
back
we
ve
plenty
of
time
do
you
smoke
have
you
your
own
here
a
cigarette
he
went
on
offering
his
visitor
a
cigarette
you
know
i
am
receiving
you
here
but
my
own
quarter
are
through
there
you
know
my
government
quarter
but
i
am
living
outside
for
the
time
i
had
to
have
some
repair
done
here
it
s
almost
finished
now
government
quarter
you
know
are
a
capital
thing
eh
what
do
you
think
yes
a
capital
thing
answered
raskolnikov
looking
at
him
almost
ironically
a
capital
thing
a
capital
thing
repeated
porfiry
petrovitch
a
though
he
had
just
thought
of
something
quite
different
yes
a
capital
thing
he
almost
shouted
at
last
suddenly
staring
at
raskolnikov
and
stopping
short
two
step
from
him
this
stupid
repetition
wa
too
incongruous
in
it
ineptitude
with
the
serious
brooding
and
enigmatic
glance
he
turned
upon
his
visitor
but
this
stirred
raskolnikov
s
spleen
more
than
ever
and
he
could
not
resist
an
ironical
and
rather
incautious
challenge
tell
me
please
he
asked
suddenly
looking
almost
insolently
at
him
and
taking
a
kind
of
pleasure
in
his
own
insolence
i
believe
it
s
a
sort
of
legal
rule
a
sort
of
legal
tradition
for
all
investigating
lawyer
to
begin
their
attack
from
afar
with
a
trivial
or
at
least
an
irrelevant
subject
so
a
to
encourage
or
rather
to
divert
the
man
they
are
to
disarm
his
caution
and
then
all
at
once
to
give
him
an
unexpected
blow
with
some
fatal
question
isn
t
that
so
it
s
a
sacred
tradition
mentioned
i
fancy
in
all
the
manual
of
the
art
yes
yes
why
do
you
imagine
that
wa
why
i
spoke
about
government
quarter
eh
and
a
he
said
this
porfiry
petrovitch
screwed
up
his
eye
and
winked
a
crafty
look
passed
over
his
face
the
wrinkle
on
his
forehead
were
smoothed
out
his
eye
contracted
his
feature
broadened
and
he
suddenly
went
off
into
a
nervous
prolonged
laugh
shaking
all
over
and
looking
raskolnikov
straight
in
the
face
the
latter
forced
himself
to
laugh
too
but
when
porfiry
seeing
that
he
wa
laughing
broke
into
such
a
guffaw
that
he
turned
almost
crimson
raskolnikov
s
repulsion
overcame
all
precaution
he
left
off
laughing
scowled
and
stared
with
hatred
at
porfiry
keeping
his
eye
fixed
on
him
while
his
intentionally
prolonged
laughter
lasted
there
wa
lack
of
precaution
on
both
side
however
for
porfiry
petrovitch
seemed
to
be
laughing
in
his
visitor
s
face
and
to
be
very
little
disturbed
at
the
annoyance
with
which
the
visitor
received
it
the
latter
fact
wa
very
significant
in
raskolnikov
s
eye
he
saw
that
porfiry
petrovitch
had
not
been
embarrassed
just
before
either
but
that
he
raskolnikov
had
perhaps
fallen
into
a
trap
that
there
must
be
something
some
motive
here
unknown
to
him
that
perhaps
everything
wa
in
readiness
and
in
another
moment
would
break
upon
him
he
went
straight
to
the
point
at
once
rose
from
his
seat
and
took
his
cap
porfiry
petrovitch
he
began
resolutely
though
with
considerable
irritation
yesterday
you
expressed
a
desire
that
i
should
come
to
you
for
some
inquiry
he
laid
special
stress
on
the
word
inquiry
i
have
come
and
if
you
have
anything
to
ask
me
ask
it
and
if
not
allow
me
to
withdraw
i
have
no
time
to
spare
i
have
to
be
at
the
funeral
of
that
man
who
wa
run
over
of
whom
you
know
also
he
added
feeling
angry
at
once
at
having
made
this
addition
and
more
irritated
at
his
anger
i
am
sick
of
it
all
do
you
hear
and
have
long
been
it
s
partly
what
made
me
ill
in
short
he
shouted
feeling
that
the
phrase
about
his
illness
wa
still
more
out
of
place
in
short
kindly
examine
me
or
let
me
go
at
once
and
if
you
must
examine
me
do
so
in
the
proper
form
i
will
not
allow
you
to
do
so
otherwise
and
so
meanwhile
a
we
have
evidently
nothing
to
keep
u
good
heaven
what
do
you
mean
what
shall
i
question
you
about
cackled
porfiry
petrovitch
with
a
change
of
tone
instantly
leaving
off
laughing
please
don
t
disturb
yourself
he
began
fidgeting
from
place
to
place
and
fussily
making
raskolnikov
sit
down
there
s
no
hurry
there
s
no
hurry
it
s
all
nonsense
oh
no
i
m
very
glad
you
ve
come
to
see
me
at
last
i
look
upon
you
simply
a
a
visitor
and
a
for
my
confounded
laughter
please
excuse
it
rodion
romanovitch
rodion
romanovitch
that
is
your
name
it
s
my
nerve
you
tickled
me
so
with
your
witty
observation
i
assure
you
sometimes
i
shake
with
laughter
like
an
ball
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
i
m
often
afraid
of
an
attack
of
paralysis
do
sit
down
please
do
or
i
shall
think
you
are
angry
raskolnikov
did
not
speak
he
listened
watching
him
still
frowning
angrily
he
did
sit
down
but
still
held
his
cap
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
about
myself
my
dear
rodion
romanovitch
porfiry
petrovitch
continued
moving
about
the
room
and
again
avoiding
his
visitor
s
eye
you
see
i
m
a
bachelor
a
man
of
no
consequence
and
not
used
to
society
besides
i
have
nothing
before
me
i
m
set
i
m
running
to
seed
and
and
have
you
noticed
rodion
romanovitch
that
in
our
petersburg
circle
if
two
clever
men
meet
who
are
not
intimate
but
respect
each
other
like
you
and
me
it
take
them
half
an
hour
before
they
can
find
a
subject
for
conversation
they
are
dumb
they
sit
opposite
each
other
and
feel
awkward
everyone
ha
subject
of
conversation
lady
for
instance
people
in
high
society
always
have
their
subject
of
conversation
est
de
but
people
of
the
middle
sort
like
u
thinking
people
that
is
are
always
and
awkward
what
is
the
reason
of
it
whether
it
is
the
lack
of
public
interest
or
whether
it
is
we
are
so
honest
we
don
t
want
to
deceive
one
another
i
don
t
know
what
do
you
think
do
put
down
your
cap

look
a
if
you
were
just
going
it
make
me
uncomfortable
i
am
so
delighted
raskolnikov
put
down
his
cap
and
continued
listening
in
silence
with
a
serious
frowning
face
to
the
vague
and
empty
chatter
of
porfiry
petrovitch
doe
he
really
want
to
distract
my
attention
with
his
silly
babble
i
can
t
offer
you
coffee
here
but
why
not
spend
five
minute
with
a
friend
porfiry
pattered
on
and
you
know
all
these
official
duty
please
don
t
mind
my
running
up
and
down
excuse
it
my
dear
fellow
i
am
very
much
afraid
of
offending
you
but
exercise
is
absolutely
indispensable
for
me
i
m
always
sitting
and
so
glad
to
be
moving
about
for
five
minute
i
suffer
from
my
sedentary
life
i
always
intend
to
join
a
gymnasium
they
say
that
official
of
all
rank
even
privy
councillor
may
be
seen
skipping
gaily
there
there
you
have
it
modern
science
yes
yes
but
a
for
my
duty
here
inquiry
and
all
such
formality
you
mentioned
inquiry
yourself
just
now
i
assure
you
these
interrogation
are
sometimes
more
embarrassing
for
the
interrogator
than
for
the
interrogated
you
made
the
observation
yourself
just
now
very
aptly
and
raskolnikov
had
made
no
observation
of
the
kind
one
get
into
a
muddle
a
regular
muddle
one
keep
harping
on
the
same
note
like
a
drum
there
is
to
be
a
reform
and
we
shall
be
called
by
a
different
name
at
least
and
a
for
our
legal
tradition
a
you
so
wittily
called
it
i
thoroughly
agree
with
you
every
prisoner
on
trial
even
the
rudest
peasant
know
that
they
begin
by
disarming
him
with
irrelevant
question
a
you
so
happily
put
it
and
then
deal
him
a
blow
your
felicitous
comparison
so
you
really
imagined
that
i
meant
by
government
quarter
you
are
an
ironical
person
come
i
won
t
go
on
ah
by
the
way
yes
one
word
lead
to
another
you
spoke
of
formality
just
now
apropos
of
the
inquiry
you
know
but
what
s
the
use
of
formality
in
many
case
it
s
nonsense
sometimes
one
ha
a
friendly
chat
and
get
a
good
deal
more
out
of
it
one
can
always
fall
back
on
formality
allow
me
to
assure
you
and
after
all
what
doe
it
amount
to
an
examining
lawyer
can
not
be
bounded
by
formality
at
every
step
the
work
of
investigation
is
so
to
speak
a
free
art
in
it
own
way
porfiry
petrovitch
took
breath
a
moment
he
had
simply
babbled
on
uttering
empty
phrase
letting
slip
a
few
enigmatic
word
and
again
reverting
to
incoherence
he
wa
almost
running
about
the
room
moving
his
fat
little
leg
quicker
and
quicker
looking
at
the
ground
with
his
right
hand
behind
his
back
while
with
his
left
making
gesticulation
that
were
extraordinarily
incongruous
with
his
word
raskolnikov
suddenly
noticed
that
a
he
ran
about
the
room
he
seemed
twice
to
stop
for
a
moment
near
the
door
a
though
he
were
listening
is
he
expecting
anything
you
are
certainly
quite
right
about
it
porfiry
began
gaily
looking
with
extraordinary
simplicity
at
raskolnikov
which
startled
him
and
instantly
put
him
on
his
guard
certainly
quite
right
in
laughing
so
wittily
at
our
legal
form
some
of
these
elaborate
psychological
method
are
exceedingly
ridiculous
and
perhaps
useless
if
one
adheres
too
closely
to
the
form
yes
i
am
talking
of
form
again
well
if
i
recognise
or
more
strictly
speaking
if
i
suspect
someone
or
other
to
be
a
criminal
in
any
case
entrusted
to
me
you
re
reading
for
the
law
of
course
rodion
romanovitch
yes
i
wa
well
then
it
is
a
precedent
for
you
for
the
future
though
don
t
suppose
i
should
venture
to
instruct
you
after
the
article
you
publish
about
crime
no
i
simply
make
bold
to
state
it
by
way
of
fact
if
i
took
this
man
or
that
for
a
criminal
why
i
ask
should
i
worry
him
prematurely
even
though
i
had
evidence
against
him
in
one
case
i
may
be
bound
for
instance
to
arrest
a
man
at
once
but
another
may
be
in
quite
a
different
position
you
know
so
why
shouldn
t
i
let
him
walk
about
the
town
a
bit
but
i
see
you
don
t
quite
understand
so
i
ll
give
you
a
clearer
example
if
i
put
him
in
prison
too
soon
i
may
very
likely
give
him
so
to
speak
moral
support
you
re
laughing
raskolnikov
had
no
idea
of
laughing
he
wa
sitting
with
compressed
lip
his
feverish
eye
fixed
on
porfiry
petrovitch
s
yet
that
is
the
case
with
some
type
especially
for
men
are
so
different
you
say
evidence
well
there
may
be
evidence
but
evidence
you
know
can
generally
be
taken
two
way
i
am
an
examining
lawyer
and
a
weak
man
i
confess
it
i
should
like
to
make
a
proof
so
to
say
mathematically
clear
i
should
like
to
make
a
chain
of
evidence
such
a
twice
two
are
four
it
ought
to
be
a
direct
irrefutable
proof
and
if
i
shut
him
up
too
soon
even
though
i
might
be
convinced
wa
the
man
i
should
very
likely
be
depriving
myself
of
the
mean
of
getting
further
evidence
against
him
and
how
by
giving
him
so
to
speak
a
definite
position
i
shall
put
him
out
of
suspense
and
set
his
mind
at
rest
so
that
he
will
retreat
into
his
shell
they
say
that
at
sevastopol
soon
after
alma
the
clever
people
were
in
a
terrible
fright
that
the
enemy
would
attack
openly
and
take
sevastopol
at
once
but
when
they
saw
that
the
enemy
preferred
a
regular
siege
they
were
delighted
i
am
told
and
reassured
for
the
thing
would
drag
on
for
two
month
at
least
you
re
laughing
you
don
t
believe
me
again
of
course
you
re
right
too
you
re
right
you
re
right
these
are
special
case
i
admit
but
you
must
observe
this
my
dear
rodion
romanovitch
the
general
case
the
case
for
which
all
legal
form
and
rule
are
intended
for
which
they
are
calculated
and
laid
down
in
book
doe
not
exist
at
all
for
the
reason
that
every
case
every
crime
for
instance
so
soon
a
it
actually
occurs
at
once
becomes
a
thoroughly
special
case
and
sometimes
a
case
unlike
any
that
s
gone
before
very
comic
case
of
that
sort
sometimes
occur
if
i
leave
one
man
quite
alone
if
i
don
t
touch
him
and
don
t
worry
him
but
let
him
know
or
at
least
suspect
every
moment
that
i
know
all
about
it
and
am
watching
him
day
and
night
and
if
he
is
in
continual
suspicion
and
terror
he
ll
be
bound
to
lose
his
head
he
ll
come
of
himself
or
maybe
do
something
which
will
make
it
a
plain
a
twice
two
are
four
it
s
delightful
it
may
be
so
with
a
simple
peasant
but
with
one
of
our
sort
an
intelligent
man
cultivated
on
a
certain
side
it
s
a
dead
certainty
for
my
dear
fellow
it
s
a
very
important
matter
to
know
on
what
side
a
man
is
cultivated
and
then
there
are
nerve
there
are
nerve
you
have
overlooked
them
why
they
are
all
sick
nervous
and
irritable
and
then
how
they
all
suffer
from
spleen
that
i
assure
you
is
a
regular
for
u
and
it
s
no
anxiety
to
me
his
running
about
the
town
free
let
him
let
him
walk
about
for
a
bit
i
know
well
enough
that
i
ve
caught
him
and
that
he
won
t
escape
me
where
could
he
escape
to
abroad
perhaps
a
pole
will
escape
abroad
but
not
here
especially
a
i
am
watching
and
have
taken
measure
will
he
escape
into
the
depth
of
the
country
perhaps
but
you
know
peasant
live
there
real
rude
russian
peasant
a
modern
cultivated
man
would
prefer
prison
to
living
with
such
stranger
a
our
peasant
but
that
s
all
nonsense
and
on
the
surface
it
s
not
merely
that
he
ha
nowhere
to
run
to
he
is
unable
to
escape
me
what
an
expression
through
a
law
of
nature
he
can
t
escape
me
if
he
had
anywhere
to
go
have
you
seen
a
butterfly
round
a
candle
that
s
how
he
will
keep
circling
and
circling
round
me
freedom
will
lose
it
attraction
he
ll
begin
to
brood
he
ll
weave
a
tangle
round
himself
he
ll
worry
himself
to
death
what
s
more
he
will
provide
me
with
a
mathematical
proof
if
i
only
give
him
long
enough
interval
and
he
ll
keep
circling
round
me
getting
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
flop
he
ll
fly
straight
into
my
mouth
and
i
ll
swallow
him
and
that
will
be
very
amusing
you
don
t
believe
me
raskolnikov
made
no
reply
he
sat
pale
and
motionless
still
gazing
with
the
same
intensity
into
porfiry
s
face
it
s
a
lesson
he
thought
turning
cold
this
is
beyond
the
cat
playing
with
a
mouse
like
yesterday
he
can
t
be
showing
off
his
power
with
no
motive
prompting
me
he
is
far
too
clever
for
that
he
must
have
another
object
what
is
it
it
s
all
nonsense
my
friend
you
are
pretending
to
scare
me
you
ve
no
proof
and
the
man
i
saw
had
no
real
existence
you
simply
want
to
make
me
lose
my
head
to
work
me
up
beforehand
and
so
to
crush
me
but
you
are
wrong
you
won
t
do
it
but
why
give
me
such
a
hint
is
he
reckoning
on
my
shattered
nerve
no
my
friend
you
are
wrong
you
won
t
do
it
even
though
you
have
some
trap
for
me
let
u
see
what
you
have
in
store
for
and
he
braced
himself
to
face
a
terrible
and
unknown
ordeal
at
time
he
longed
to
fall
on
porfiry
and
strangle
him
this
anger
wa
what
he
dreaded
from
the
beginning
he
felt
that
his
parched
lip
were
flecked
with
foam
his
heart
wa
throbbing
but
he
wa
still
determined
not
to
speak
till
the
right
moment
he
realised
that
this
wa
the
best
policy
in
his
position
because
instead
of
saying
too
much
he
would
be
irritating
his
enemy
by
his
silence
and
provoking
him
into
speaking
too
freely
anyhow
this
wa
what
he
hoped
for
no
i
see
you
don
t
believe
me
you
think
i
am
playing
a
harmless
joke
on
you
porfiry
began
again
getting
more
and
more
lively
chuckling
at
every
instant
and
again
pacing
round
the
room
and
to
be
sure
you
re
right
god
ha
given
me
a
figure
that
can
awaken
none
but
comic
idea
in
other
people
a
buffoon
but
let
me
tell
you
and
i
repeat
it
excuse
an
old
man
my
dear
rodion
romanovitch
you
are
a
man
still
young
so
to
say
in
your
first
youth
and
so
you
put
intellect
above
everything
like
all
young
people
playful
wit
and
abstract
argument
fascinate
you
and
that
s
for
all
the
world
like
the
old
austrian
a
far
a
i
can
judge
of
military
matter
that
is
on
paper
they
d
beaten
napoleon
and
taken
him
prisoner
and
there
in
their
study
they
worked
it
all
out
in
the
cleverest
fashion
but
look
you
general
mack
surrendered
with
all
his
army
i
see
i
see
rodion
romanovitch
you
are
laughing
at
a
civilian
like
me
taking
example
out
of
military
history
but
i
can
t
help
it
it
s
my
weakness
i
am
fond
of
military
science
and
i
m
ever
so
fond
of
reading
all
military
history
i
ve
certainly
missed
my
proper
career
i
ought
to
have
been
in
the
army
upon
my
word
i
ought
i
shouldn
t
have
been
a
napoleon
but
i
might
have
been
a
major
well
i
ll
tell
you
the
whole
truth
my
dear
fellow
about
this
i
mean
actual
fact
and
a
man
s
temperament
my
dear
sir
are
weighty
matter
and
it
s
astonishing
how
they
sometimes
deceive
the
sharpest
calculation
i
listen
to
an
old
man
am
speaking
seriously
rodion
romanovitch
a
he
said
this
porfiry
petrovitch
who
wa
scarcely
actually
seemed
to
have
grown
old
even
his
voice
changed
and
he
seemed
to
shrink
together
moreover
i
m
a
candid
man
am
i
a
candid
man
or
not
what
do
you
say
i
fancy
i
really
am
i
tell
you
these
thing
for
nothing
and
don
t
even
expect
a
reward
for
it
well
to
proceed
wit
in
my
opinion
is
a
splendid
thing
it
is
so
to
say
an
adornment
of
nature
and
a
consolation
of
life
and
what
trick
it
can
play
so
that
it
sometimes
is
hard
for
a
poor
examining
lawyer
to
know
where
he
is
especially
when
he
s
liable
to
be
carried
away
by
his
own
fancy
too
for
you
know
he
is
a
man
after
all
but
the
poor
fellow
is
saved
by
the
criminal
s
temperament
worse
luck
for
him
but
young
people
carried
away
by
their
own
wit
don
t
think
of
that
when
they
overstep
all
obstacle
a
you
wittily
and
cleverly
expressed
it
yesterday
he
will
lie
that
is
the
man
who
is
a
the
incognito
and
he
will
lie
well
in
the
cleverest
fashion
you
might
think
he
would
triumph
and
enjoy
the
fruit
of
his
wit
but
at
the
most
interesting
the
most
flagrant
moment
he
will
faint
of
course
there
may
be
illness
and
a
stuffy
room
a
well
but
anyway
anyway
he
s
given
u
the
idea
he
lied
incomparably
but
he
didn
t
reckon
on
his
temperament
that
s
what
betrays
him
another
time
he
will
be
carried
away
by
his
playful
wit
into
making
fun
of
the
man
who
suspect
him
he
will
turn
pale
a
it
were
on
purpose
to
mislead
but
his
paleness
will
be
too
much
like
the
real
thing
again
he
ha
given
u
an
idea
though
his
questioner
may
be
deceived
at
first
he
will
think
differently
next
day
if
he
is
not
a
fool
and
of
course
it
is
like
that
at
every
step
he
put
himself
forward
where
he
is
not
wanted
speaks
continually
when
he
ought
to
keep
silent
brings
in
all
sort
of
allegorical
allusion
come
and
asks
why
didn
t
you
take
me
long
ago
and
that
can
happen
you
know
with
the
cleverest
man
the
psychologist
the
literary
man
the
temperament
reflects
everything
like
a
mirror
gaze
into
it
and
admire
what
you
see
but
why
are
you
so
pale
rodion
romanovitch
is
the
room
stuffy
shall
i
open
the
window
oh
don
t
trouble
please
cried
raskolnikov
and
he
suddenly
broke
into
a
laugh
please
don
t
porfiry
stood
facing
him
paused
a
moment
and
suddenly
he
too
laughed
raskolnikov
got
up
from
the
sofa
abruptly
checking
his
hysterical
laughter
porfiry
petrovitch
he
began
speaking
loudly
and
distinctly
though
his
leg
trembled
and
he
could
scarcely
stand
i
see
clearly
at
last
that
you
actually
suspect
me
of
murdering
that
old
woman
and
her
sister
lizaveta
let
me
tell
you
for
my
part
that
i
am
sick
of
this
if
you
find
that
you
have
a
right
to
prosecute
me
legally
to
arrest
me
then
prosecute
me
arrest
me
but
i
will
not
let
myself
be
jeered
at
to
my
face
and
worried
his
lip
trembled
his
eye
glowed
with
fury
and
he
could
not
restrain
his
voice
i
won
t
allow
it
he
shouted
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
do
you
hear
that
porfiry
petrovitch
i
won
t
allow
good
heaven
what
doe
it
mean
cried
porfiry
petrovitch
apparently
quite
frightened
rodion
romanovitch
my
dear
fellow
what
is
the
matter
with
you
i
won
t
allow
it
raskolnikov
shouted
again
hush
my
dear
man
they
ll
hear
and
come
in
just
think
what
could
we
say
to
them
porfiry
petrovitch
whispered
in
horror
bringing
his
face
close
to
raskolnikov
s
i
won
t
allow
it
i
won
t
allow
it
raskolnikov
repeated
mechanically
but
he
too
spoke
in
a
sudden
whisper
porfiry
turned
quickly
and
ran
to
open
the
window
some
fresh
air
and
you
must
have
some
water
my
dear
fellow
you
re
ill
and
he
wa
running
to
the
door
to
call
for
some
when
he
found
a
decanter
of
water
in
the
corner
come
drink
a
little
he
whispered
rushing
up
to
him
with
the
decanter
it
will
be
sure
to
do
you
porfiry
petrovitch
s
alarm
and
sympathy
were
so
natural
that
raskolnikov
wa
silent
and
began
looking
at
him
with
wild
curiosity
he
did
not
take
the
water
however
rodion
romanovitch
my
dear
fellow
you
ll
drive
yourself
out
of
your
mind
i
assure
you
ach
ach
have
some
water
do
drink
a
he
forced
him
to
take
the
glass
raskolnikov
raised
it
mechanically
to
his
lip
but
set
it
on
the
table
again
with
disgust
yes
you
ve
had
a
little
attack
you
ll
bring
back
your
illness
again
my
dear
fellow
porfiry
petrovitch
cackled
with
friendly
sympathy
though
he
still
looked
rather
disconcerted
good
heaven
you
must
take
more
care
of
yourself
dmitri
prokofitch
wa
here
came
to
see
me
yesterday
i
know
i
know
i
ve
a
nasty
ironical
temper
but
what
they
made
of
it
good
heaven
he
came
yesterday
after
you
d
been
we
dined
and
he
talked
and
talked
away
and
i
could
only
throw
up
my
hand
in
despair
did
he
come
from
you
but
do
sit
down
for
mercy
s
sake
sit
down
no
not
from
me
but
i
knew
he
went
to
you
and
why
he
went
raskolnikov
answered
sharply
you
knew
i
knew
what
of
it
why
this
rodion
romanovitch
that
i
know
more
than
that
about
you
i
know
about
everything
i
know
how
you
went
take
a
at
night
when
it
wa
dark
and
how
you
rang
the
bell
and
asked
about
the
blood
so
that
the
workman
and
the
porter
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
yes
i
understand
your
state
of
mind
at
that
time
but
you
ll
drive
yourself
mad
like
that
upon
my
word
you
ll
lose
your
head
you
re
full
of
generous
indignation
at
the
wrong
you
ve
received
first
from
destiny
and
then
from
the
police
officer
and
so
you
rush
from
one
thing
to
another
to
force
them
to
speak
out
and
make
an
end
of
it
all
because
you
are
sick
of
all
this
suspicion
and
foolishness
that
s
so
isn
t
it
i
have
guessed
how
you
feel
haven
t
i
only
in
that
way
you
ll
lose
your
head
and
razumihin
s
too
he
s
too
a
man
for
such
a
position
you
must
know
that
you
are
ill
and
he
is
good
and
your
illness
is
infectious
for
him
i
ll
tell
you
about
it
when
you
are
more
yourself
but
do
sit
down
for
goodness
sake
please
rest
you
look
shocking
do
sit
raskolnikov
sat
down
he
no
longer
shivered
he
wa
hot
all
over
in
amazement
he
listened
with
strained
attention
to
porfiry
petrovitch
who
still
seemed
frightened
a
he
looked
after
him
with
friendly
solicitude
but
he
did
not
believe
a
word
he
said
though
he
felt
a
strange
inclination
to
believe
porfiry
s
unexpected
word
about
the
flat
had
utterly
overwhelmed
him
how
can
it
be
he
know
about
the
flat
then
he
thought
suddenly
and
he
tell
it
me
himself
yes
in
our
legal
practice
there
wa
a
case
almost
exactly
similar
a
case
of
morbid
psychology
porfiry
went
on
quickly
a
man
confessed
to
murder
and
how
he
kept
it
up
it
wa
a
regular
hallucination
he
brought
forward
fact
he
imposed
upon
everyone
and
why
he
had
been
partly
but
only
partly
unintentionally
the
cause
of
a
murder
and
when
he
knew
that
he
had
given
the
murderer
the
opportunity
he
sank
into
dejection
it
got
on
his
mind
and
turned
his
brain
he
began
imagining
thing
and
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
wa
the
murderer
but
at
last
the
high
court
of
appeal
went
into
it
and
the
poor
fellow
wa
acquitted
and
put
under
proper
care
thanks
to
the
court
of
appeal
why
my
dear
fellow
you
may
drive
yourself
into
delirium
if
you
have
the
impulse
to
work
upon
your
nerve
to
go
ringing
bell
at
night
and
asking
about
blood
i
ve
studied
all
this
morbid
psychology
in
my
practice
a
man
is
sometimes
tempted
to
jump
out
of
a
window
or
from
a
belfry
just
the
same
with
it
s
all
illness
rodion
romanovitch
you
have
begun
to
neglect
your
illness
you
should
consult
an
experienced
doctor
what
s
the
good
of
that
fat
fellow
you
are
lightheaded
you
were
delirious
when
you
did
all
this
for
a
moment
raskolnikov
felt
everything
going
round
is
it
possible
is
it
possible
flashed
through
his
mind
that
he
is
still
lying
he
can
t
be
he
can
t
he
rejected
that
idea
feeling
to
what
a
degree
of
fury
it
might
drive
him
feeling
that
that
fury
might
drive
him
mad
i
wa
not
delirious
i
knew
what
i
wa
doing
he
cried
straining
every
faculty
to
penetrate
porfiry
s
game
i
wa
quite
myself
do
you
hear
yes
i
hear
and
understand
you
said
yesterday
you
were
not
delirious
you
were
particularly
emphatic
about
it
i
understand
all
you
can
tell
me
listen
rodion
romanovitch
my
dear
fellow
if
you
were
actually
a
criminal
or
were
somehow
mixed
up
in
this
damnable
business
would
you
insist
that
you
were
not
delirious
but
in
full
possession
of
your
faculty
and
so
emphatically
and
persistently
would
it
be
possible
quite
impossible
to
my
thinking
if
you
had
anything
on
your
conscience
you
certainly
ought
to
insist
that
you
were
delirious
that
s
so
isn
t
it
there
wa
a
note
of
slyness
in
this
inquiry
raskolnikov
drew
back
on
the
sofa
a
porfiry
bent
over
him
and
stared
in
silent
perplexity
at
him
another
thing
about
razumihin
you
certainly
ought
to
have
said
that
he
came
of
his
own
accord
to
have
concealed
your
part
in
it
but
you
don
t
conceal
it
you
lay
stress
on
his
coming
at
your
raskolnikov
had
not
done
so
a
chill
went
down
his
back
you
keep
telling
lie
he
said
slowly
and
weakly
twisting
his
lip
into
a
sickly
smile
you
are
trying
again
to
show
that
you
know
all
my
game
that
you
know
all
i
shall
say
beforehand
he
said
conscious
himself
that
he
wa
not
weighing
his
word
a
he
ought
you
want
to
frighten
me
or
you
are
simply
laughing
at
me
he
still
stared
at
him
a
he
said
this
and
again
there
wa
a
light
of
intense
hatred
in
his
eye
you
keep
lying
he
said
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
best
policy
for
the
criminal
is
to
tell
the
truth
a
nearly
a
possible
to
conceal
a
little
a
possible
i
don
t
believe
you
what
a
wily
person
you
are
porfiry
tittered
there
s
no
catching
you
you
ve
a
perfect
monomania
so
you
don
t
believe
me
but
still
you
do
believe
me
you
believe
a
quarter
i
ll
soon
make
you
believe
the
whole
because
i
have
a
sincere
liking
for
you
and
genuinely
wish
you
raskolnikov
s
lip
trembled
yes
i
do
went
on
porfiry
touching
raskolnikov
s
arm
genially
you
must
take
care
of
your
illness
besides
your
mother
and
sister
are
here
now
you
must
think
of
them
you
must
soothe
and
comfort
them
and
you
do
nothing
but
frighten
them
what
ha
that
to
do
with
you
how
do
you
know
it
what
concern
is
it
of
yours
you
are
keeping
watch
on
me
and
want
to
let
me
know
it
good
heaven
why
i
learnt
it
all
from
you
yourself
you
don
t
notice
that
in
your
excitement
you
tell
me
and
others
everything
from
razumihin
too
i
learnt
a
number
of
interesting
detail
yesterday
no
you
interrupted
me
but
i
must
tell
you
that
for
all
your
wit
your
suspiciousness
make
you
lose
the
view
of
thing
to
return
to
for
instance
i
an
examining
lawyer
have
betrayed
a
precious
thing
like
that
a
real
fact
for
it
is
a
fact
worth
having
and
you
see
nothing
in
it
why
if
i
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
you
should
i
have
acted
like
that
no
i
should
first
have
disarmed
your
suspicion
and
not
let
you
see
i
knew
of
that
fact
should
have
diverted
your
attention
and
suddenly
have
dealt
you
a
blow
your
expression
saying
and
what
were
you
doing
sir
pray
at
ten
or
nearly
eleven
at
the
murdered
woman
s
flat
and
why
did
you
ring
the
bell
and
why
did
you
ask
about
blood
and
why
did
you
invite
the
porter
to
go
with
you
to
the
police
station
to
the
lieutenant
that
s
how
i
ought
to
have
acted
if
i
had
a
grain
of
suspicion
of
you
i
ought
to
have
taken
your
evidence
in
due
form
searched
your
lodging
and
perhaps
have
arrested
you
too
so
i
have
no
suspicion
of
you
since
i
have
not
done
that
but
you
can
t
look
at
it
normally
and
you
see
nothing
i
say
raskolnikov
started
so
that
porfiry
petrovitch
could
not
fail
to
perceive
it
you
are
lying
all
the
while
he
cried
i
don
t
know
your
object
but
you
are
lying
you
did
not
speak
like
that
just
now
and
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
am
lying
porfiry
repeated
apparently
incensed
but
preserving
a
and
ironical
face
a
though
he
were
not
in
the
least
concerned
at
raskolnikov
s
opinion
of
him
i
am
lying
but
how
did
i
treat
you
just
now
i
the
examining
lawyer
prompting
you
and
giving
you
every
mean
for
your
defence
illness
i
said
delirium
injury
melancholy
and
the
police
officer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
ah
though
indeed
all
those
psychological
mean
of
defence
are
not
very
reliable
and
cut
both
way
illness
delirium
i
don
t
remember
that
s
all
right
but
why
my
good
sir
in
your
illness
and
in
your
delirium
were
you
haunted
by
just
those
delusion
and
not
by
any
others
there
may
have
been
others
eh
raskolnikov
looked
haughtily
and
contemptuously
at
him
briefly
he
said
loudly
and
imperiously
rising
to
his
foot

porfiry
with
a
perfectly
sly
and
composed
face
and
why

to
know
why
do
you

so
much
since
they
haven
t
begun
to
worry
you
why
you
are
like
a
child
asking
for
match
and
why
are
you
so
uneasy
why
do

force
yourself
upon
u
eh
i
repeat
raskolnikov
cried
furiously
that

shouted
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
again
hush

ll
overhear
i
warn
you
seriously

care
of

porfiry
whispered
but
this
time
there
wa
not
the
look
of
old
womanish
good
nature
and
alarm
in
his
face
now
he
wa
peremptory
stern
frowning
and
for
once
laying
aside
all
mystification
but
this
wa
only
for
an
instant
raskolnikov
bewildered
suddenly
fell
into
actual
frenzy
but
strange
to
say
he
again
obeyed
the
command
to
speak
quietly
though
he
wa
in
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
fury
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
be
tortured
he
whispered
instantly
recognising
with
hatred
that
he
could
not
help
obeying
the
command
and
driven
to
even
greater
fury
by
the
thought
arrest
me
search
me
but
kindly
act
in
due
form
and
don
t
play
with
me
don
t
dare
don
t
worry
about
the
form
porfiry
interrupted
with
the
same
sly
smile
a
it
were
gloating
with
enjoyment
over
raskolnikov
i
invited
you
to
see
me
quite
in
a
friendly
i
don
t
want
your
friendship
and
i
spit
on
it
do
you
hear
and
here
i
take
my
cap
and
go
what
will
you
say
now
if
you
mean
to
arrest
me
he
took
up
his
cap
and
went
to
the
door
and
won
t
you
see
my
little
surprise
chuckled
porfiry
again
taking
him
by
the
arm
and
stopping
him
at
the
door
he
seemed
to
become
more
playful
and
which
maddened
raskolnikov
what
surprise
he
asked
standing
still
and
looking
at
porfiry
in
alarm
my
little
surprise
it
s
sitting
there
behind
the
door
he
pointed
to
the
locked
door
i
locked
him
in
that
he
should
not
what
is
it
where
what
raskolnikov
walked
to
the
door
and
would
have
opened
it
but
it
wa
locked
it
s
locked
here
is
the
key
and
he
brought
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
you
are
lying
roared
raskolnikov
without
restraint
you
lie
you
damned
punchinello
and
he
rushed
at
porfiry
who
retreated
to
the
other
door
not
at
all
alarmed
i
understand
it
all
you
are
lying
and
mocking
so
that
i
may
betray
myself
to

not
betray
yourself

clerk

and
tried
to
work
me
into
a
frenzy
to
make
me
betray
myself
that
wa
your
object
produce
your
fact
i
understand

only
wretched
rubbishly
suspicion
like
zametov
s
you
knew
my
character
you
wanted
to
drive
me
to
fury
and
then
to
knock
me
down
with
priest
and
deputy

you
waiting
for
them
eh

them
why
deputy
my
good
man
what
thing
people

imagine
and
to

not
be
acting
in
form
a
you
say
you
don
t
know
the
business
my
dear
fellow
and
there
s
no
escaping
form
a
you
see
porfiry
muttered
listening
at
the
door
through
which
a
noise
could
be
heard
ah
they
re
coming
cried
raskolnikov
you
ve
sent
for
them

expected
them
well
produce
them
all
your
deputy
your
witness
what
you
like
i
am
ready
but
at
this
moment
a
strange
incident
occurred
something
so
unexpected
that
neither
raskolnikov
nor
porfiry
petrovitch
could
have
looked
for
such
a
conclusion
to
their
interview
chapter
vi
when
he
remembered
the
scene
afterwards
this
is
how
raskolnikov
saw
it
the
noise
behind
the
door
increased
and
suddenly
the
door
wa
opened
a
little
what
is
it
cried
porfiry
petrovitch
annoyed
why
i
gave
order
for
an
instant
there
wa
no
answer
but
it
wa
evident
that
there
were
several
person
at
the
door
and
that
they
were
apparently
pushing
somebody
back
what
is
it
porfiry
petrovitch
repeated
uneasily
the
prisoner
nikolay
ha
been
brought
someone
answered
he
is
not
wanted
take
him
away
let
him
wait
what
s
he
doing
here
how
irregular
cried
porfiry
rushing
to
the
door
but
he
began
the
same
voice
and
suddenly
ceased
two
second
not
more
were
spent
in
actual
struggle
then
someone
gave
a
violent
shove
and
then
a
man
very
pale
strode
into
the
room
this
man
s
appearance
wa
at
first
sight
very
strange
he
stared
straight
before
him
a
though
seeing
nothing
there
wa
a
determined
gleam
in
his
eye
at
the
same
time
there
wa
a
deathly
pallor
in
his
face
a
though
he
were
being
led
to
the
scaffold
his
white
lip
were
faintly
twitching
he
wa
dressed
like
a
workman
and
wa
of
medium
height
very
young
slim
his
hair
cut
in
round
crop
with
thin
spare
feature
the
man
whom
he
had
thrust
back
followed
him
into
the
room
and
succeeded
in
seizing
him
by
the
shoulder
he
wa
a
warder
but
nikolay
pulled
his
arm
away
several
person
crowded
inquisitively
into
the
doorway
some
of
them
tried
to
get
in
all
this
took
place
almost
instantaneously
go
away
it
s
too
soon
wait
till
you
are
sent
for
why
have
you
brought
him
so
soon
porfiry
petrovitch
muttered
extremely
annoyed
and
a
it
were
thrown
out
of
his
reckoning
but
nikolay
suddenly
knelt
down
what
s
the
matter
cried
porfiry
surprised
i
am
guilty
mine
is
the
sin
i
am
the
murderer
nikolay
articulated
suddenly
rather
breathless
but
speaking
fairly
loudly
for
ten
second
there
wa
silence
a
though
all
had
been
struck
dumb
even
the
warder
stepped
back
mechanically
retreated
to
the
door
and
stood
immovable
what
is
it
cried
porfiry
petrovitch
recovering
from
his
momentary
stupefaction
i
am
the
murderer
repeated
nikolay
after
a
brief
pause
what
you
what
whom
did
you
kill
porfiry
petrovitch
wa
obviously
bewildered

moment

he
added
suddenly
and
wa
again
silent
he
still
remained
on
his
knee
porfiry
petrovitch
stood
for
some
moment
a
though
meditating
but
suddenly
roused
himself
and
waved
back
the
uninvited
spectator
they
instantly
vanished
and
closed
the
door
then
he
looked
towards
raskolnikov
who
wa
standing
in
the
corner
staring
wildly
at
nikolay
and
moved
towards
him
but
stopped
short
looked
from
nikolay
to
raskolnikov
and
then
again
at
nikolay
and
seeming
unable
to
restrain
himself
darted
at
the
latter
you
re
in
too
great
a
hurry
he
shouted
at
him
almost
angrily
i
didn
t
ask
you
what
came
over
you
speak

time

to

them

scent
i
ran
after

replied
hurriedly
a
though
he
had
prepared
the
answer
i
knew
it
cried
porfiry
with
vexation
it
s
not
his
own
tale
he
is
telling
he
muttered
a
though
to
himself
and
suddenly
his
eye
rested
on
raskolnikov
again
he
wa
apparently
so
taken
up
with
nikolay
that
for
a
moment
he
had
forgotten
raskolnikov
he
wa
a
little
taken
aback
my
dear
rodion
romanovitch

flew
up
to

arm

the
door
i
suppose

didn
t
expect

said
raskolnikov
who
though
he
had
not
yet
fully
grasped
the
situation
had
regained
his
courage
you
did
not

and

little
surprise

to

raskolnikov
said
sarcastically
why
his
teeth
are
chattering
a
he
asks
you
are
an
ironical
person
come
till
we
meet
i
believe

can
say
that

in
god

hand
muttered
porfiry
with
an
unnatural
smile
a
he
walked
through
the
office
raskolnikov
noticed
that
many
people
were
looking
at
him
among
them
he
saw
the
two
porter
from
house
whom
he
had
invited
that
night
to
the
police
station
they
stood
there
waiting
but
he
wa
no
sooner
on
the
stair
than
he
heard
the
voice
of
porfiry
petrovitch
behind
him
turning
round
he
saw
the
latter
running
after
him
out
of
breath
one
word
rodion
romanovitch
a
to
all
the
rest

a
matter

t
we
and
porfiry
stood
still
facing
him
with
a
smile
shan
t
we
he
added
again
he
seemed
to
want
to
say
something
more
but
could
not
speak
out
you
must
forgive
me
porfiry
petrovitch
for
what
ha
just
passed
i
lost
my
temper
began
raskolnikov
who
had
so
far
regained
his
courage
that
he
felt
irresistibly
inclined
to
display
his
coolness
don
t
mention
it
don
t
mention
it
porfiry
replied
almost
gleefully
i
myself
too
i
have
a
wicked
temper
i
admit
it
but
we
shall
meet
again

each
other

and
through
added
raskolnikov
yes
know
each
other
through
and
through
assented
porfiry
petrovitch
and
he
screwed
up
his
eye
looking
earnestly
at
raskolnikov
now
you
re
going
to
a
birthday
party

a
of
course

don
t

what
to

said
raskolnikov
who
had
begun
to
descend
the
stair
but
looked
back
again
i
should
like
to
wish
you
success
but
your
office
is
such
a
comical
why
comical
porfiry
petrovitch
had
turned
to
go
but
he
seemed
to
prick
up
his
ear
at
this
why
how
you
must
have
been
torturing
and
harassing
that
poor
nikolay
psychologically
after
your
fashion
till
he
confessed
you
must
have
been
at
him
day
and
night
proving
to
him
that
he
wa
the
murderer
and
now
that
he
ha
confessed
you
ll
begin
vivisecting
him
again

admit
it
s
a
comical
business
you

then
that
i
said
to
nikolay
just
now
that

wa
not

tale

raskolnikov
walked
straight
home
he
wa
so
muddled
and
bewildered
that
on
getting
home
he
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
the
sofa
trying
to
collect
his
thought
he
did
not
attempt
to
think
about
nikolay
he
wa
stupefied
he
felt
that
his
confession
wa
something
inexplicable
amazing
something
beyond
his
understanding
but
nikolay
s
confession
wa
an
actual
fact
the
consequence
of
this
fact
were
clear
to
him
at
once
it
falsehood
could
not
fail
to
be
discovered
and
then
they
would
be
after
him
again
till
then
at
least
he
wa
free
and
must
do
something
for
himself
for
the
danger
wa
imminent
but
how
imminent
his
position
gradually
became
clear
to
him
remembering
sketchily
the
main
outline
of
his
recent
scene
with
porfiry
he
could
not
help
shuddering
again
with
horror
of
course
he
did
not
yet
know
all
porfiry
s
aim
he
could
not
see
into
all
his
calculation
but
he
had
already
partly
shown
his
hand
and
no
one
knew
better
than
raskolnikov
how
terrible
porfiry
s
lead
had
been
for
him
a
little
more
and
he
have
given
himself
away
completely
circumstantially
knowing
his
nervous
temperament
and
from
the
first
glance
seeing
through
him
porfiry
though
playing
a
bold
game
wa
bound
to
win
there
s
no
denying
that
raskolnikov
had
compromised
himself
seriously
but
no
had
come
to
light
a
yet
there
wa
nothing
positive
but
wa
he
taking
a
true
view
of
the
position
wasn
t
he
mistaken
what
had
porfiry
been
trying
to
get
at
had
he
really
some
surprise
prepared
for
him
and
what
wa
it
had
he
really
been
expecting
something
or
not
how
would
they
have
parted
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
unexpected
appearance
of
nikolay
porfiry
had
shown
almost
all
his
card
of
course
he
had
risked
something
in
showing
them
and
if
he
had
really
had
anything
up
his
sleeve
raskolnikov
reflected
he
would
have
shown
that
too
what
wa
that
surprise
wa
it
a
joke
had
it
meant
anything
could
it
have
concealed
anything
like
a
fact
a
piece
of
positive
evidence
his
yesterday
s
visitor
what
had
become
of
him
where
wa
he
if
porfiry
really
had
any
evidence
it
must
be
connected
with
him
he
sat
on
the
sofa
with
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
face
hidden
in
his
hand
he
wa
still
shivering
nervously
at
last
he
got
up
took
his
cap
thought
a
minute
and
went
to
the
door
he
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
for
at
least
he
might
consider
himself
out
of
danger
he
had
a
sudden
sense
almost
of
joy
he
wanted
to
make
haste
to
katerina
ivanovna
s
he
would
be
too
late
for
the
funeral
of
course
but
he
would
be
in
time
for
the
memorial
dinner
and
there
at
once
he
would
see
sonia
he
stood
still
thought
a
moment
and
a
suffering
smile
came
for
a
moment
on
to
his
lip
he
repeated
to
himself
yes
so
it
must
be
but
a
he
wa
about
to
open
the
door
it
began
opening
of
itself
he
started
and
moved
back
the
door
opened
gently
and
slowly
and
there
suddenly
appeared
a
figure
yesterday
s
visitor
the
man
stood
in
the
doorway
looked
at
raskolnikov
without
speaking
and
took
a
step
forward
into
the
room
he
wa
exactly
the
same
a
yesterday
the
same
figure
the
same
dress
but
there
wa
a
great
change
in
his
face
he
looked
dejected
and
sighed
deeply
if
he
had
only
put
his
hand
up
to
his
cheek
and
leaned
his
head
on
one
side
he
would
have
looked
exactly
like
a
peasant
woman
what
do
you
want
asked
raskolnikov
numb
with
terror
the
man
wa
still
silent
but
suddenly
he
bowed
down
almost
to
the
ground
touching
it
with
his
finger
what
is
it
cried
raskolnikov
i
have
sinned
the
man
articulated
softly
how
by
evil
they
looked
at
one
another
i
wa
vexed
when
you
came
perhaps
in
drink
and
bade
the
porter
go
to
the
police
station
and
asked
about
the
blood
i
wa
vexed
that
they
let
you
go
and
took
you
for
drunken
i
wa
so
vexed
that
i
lost
my
sleep
and
remembering
the
address
we
came
here
yesterday
and
asked
for
you
who
came
raskolnikov
interrupted
instantly
beginning
to
recollect
i
did
i
ve
wronged
then
you
come
from
that
house
i
wa
standing
at
the
gate
with
them
don
t
you
remember
we
have
carried
on
our
trade
in
that
house
for
year
past
we
cure
and
prepare
hide
we
take
work
home
most
of
all
i
wa
vexed
and
the
whole
scene
of
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
gateway
came
clearly
before
raskolnikov
s
mind
he
recollected
that
there
had
been
several
people
there
besides
the
porter
woman
among
them
he
remembered
one
voice
had
suggested
taking
him
straight
to
the
he
could
not
recall
the
face
of
the
speaker
and
even
now
he
did
not
recognise
it
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
turned
round
and
made
him
some
answer
so
this
wa
the
solution
of
yesterday
s
horror
the
most
awful
thought
wa
that
he
had
been
actually
almost
lost
had
almost
done
for
himself
on
account
of
such
a
circumstance
so
this
man
could
tell
nothing
except
his
asking
about
the
flat
and
the
blood
stain
so
porfiry
too
had
nothing
but
that
no
fact
but
this
which
both
nothing
positive
so
if
no
more
fact
come
to
light
and
they
must
not
they
must
not
then
then
what
can
they
do
to
him
how
can
they
convict
him
even
if
they
arrest
him
and
porfiry
then
had
only
just
heard
about
the
flat
and
had
not
known
about
it
before
wa
it
you
who
told
porfiry
that
i
d
been
there
he
cried
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
what
porfiry
the
head
of
the
detective
department
yes
the
porter
did
not
go
there
but
i
i
got
there
two
minute
before
you
and
i
heard
i
heard
it
all
how
he
worried
where
what
when
why
in
the
next
room
i
wa
sitting
there
all
the
what
why
then
you
were
the
surprise
but
how
could
it
happen
upon
my
word
i
saw
that
the
porter
did
not
want
to
do
what
i
said
began
the
man
for
it
s
too
late
said
they
and
maybe
he
ll
be
angry
that
we
did
not
come
at
the
time
i
wa
vexed
and
i
lost
my
sleep
and
i
began
making
inquiry
and
finding
out
yesterday
where
to
go
i
went
the
first
time
i
went
he
wasn
t
there
when
i
came
an
hour
later
he
couldn
t
see
me
i
went
the
third
time
and
they
showed
me
in
i
informed
him
of
everything
just
a
it
happened
and
he
began
skipping
about
the
room
and
punching
himself
on
the
chest
what
do
you
scoundrel
mean
by
it
if
i
d
known
about
it
i
should
have
arrested
him
then
he
ran
out
called
somebody
and
began
talking
to
him
in
the
corner
then
he
turned
to
me
scolding
and
questioning
me
he
scolded
me
a
great
deal
and
i
told
him
everything
and
i
told
him
that
you
didn
t
dare
to
say
a
word
in
answer
to
me
yesterday
and
that
you
didn
t
recognise
me
and
he
fell
to
running
about
again
and
kept
hitting
himself
on
the
chest
and
getting
angry
and
running
about
and
when
you
were
announced
he
told
me
to
go
into
the
next
room
sit
there
a
bit
he
said
don
t
move
whatever
you
may
and
he
set
a
chair
there
for
me
and
locked
me
in
perhaps
he
said
i
may
call
and
when
nikolay
d
been
brought
he
let
me
out
a
soon
a
you
were
gone
i
shall
send
for
you
again
and
question
you
he
and
did
he
question
nikolay
while
you
were
there
he
got
rid
of
me
a
he
did
of
you
before
he
spoke
to
the
man
stood
still
and
again
suddenly
bowed
down
touching
the
ground
with
his
finger
forgive
me
for
my
evil
thought
and
my
may
god
forgive
you
answered
raskolnikov
and
a
he
said
this
the
man
bowed
down
again
but
not
to
the
ground
turned
slowly
and
went
out
of
the
room
it
all
cut
both
way
now
it
all
cut
both
way
repeated
raskolnikov
and
he
went
out
more
confident
than
ever
now
we
ll
make
a
fight
for
it
he
said
with
a
malicious
smile
a
he
went
down
the
stair
his
malice
wa
aimed
at
himself
with
shame
and
contempt
he
recollected
his
part
v
chapter
i
the
morning
that
followed
the
fateful
interview
with
dounia
and
her
mother
brought
sobering
influence
to
bear
on
pyotr
petrovitch
intensely
unpleasant
a
it
wa
he
wa
forced
little
by
little
to
accept
a
a
fact
beyond
recall
what
had
seemed
to
him
only
the
day
before
fantastic
and
incredible
the
black
snake
of
wounded
vanity
had
been
gnawing
at
his
heart
all
night
when
he
got
out
of
bed
pyotr
petrovitch
immediately
looked
in
the
he
wa
afraid
that
he
had
jaundice
however
his
health
seemed
unimpaired
so
far
and
looking
at
his
noble
countenance
which
had
grown
fattish
of
late
pyotr
petrovitch
for
an
instant
wa
positively
comforted
in
the
conviction
that
he
would
find
another
bride
and
perhaps
even
a
better
one
but
coming
back
to
the
sense
of
his
present
position
he
turned
aside
and
spat
vigorously
which
excited
a
sarcastic
smile
in
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
the
young
friend
with
whom
he
wa
staying
that
smile
pyotr
petrovitch
noticed
and
at
once
set
it
down
against
his
young
friend
s
account
he
had
set
down
a
good
many
point
against
him
of
late
his
anger
wa
redoubled
when
he
reflected
that
he
ought
not
to
have
told
andrey
semyonovitch
about
the
result
of
yesterday
s
interview
that
wa
the
second
mistake
he
had
made
in
temper
through
impulsiveness
and
irritability
moreover
all
that
morning
one
unpleasantness
followed
another
he
even
found
a
hitch
awaiting
him
in
his
legal
case
in
the
senate
he
wa
particularly
irritated
by
the
owner
of
the
flat
which
had
been
taken
in
view
of
his
approaching
marriage
and
wa
being
redecorated
at
his
own
expense
the
owner
a
rich
german
tradesman
would
not
entertain
the
idea
of
breaking
the
contract
which
had
just
been
signed
and
insisted
on
the
full
forfeit
money
though
pyotr
petrovitch
would
be
giving
him
back
the
flat
practically
redecorated
in
the
same
way
the
upholsterer
refused
to
return
a
single
rouble
of
the
instalment
paid
for
the
furniture
purchased
but
not
yet
removed
to
the
flat
am
i
to
get
married
simply
for
the
sake
of
the
furniture
pyotr
petrovitch
ground
his
teeth
and
at
the
same
time
once
more
he
had
a
gleam
of
desperate
hope
can
all
that
be
really
so
irrevocably
over
is
it
no
use
to
make
another
effort
the
thought
of
dounia
sent
a
voluptuous
pang
through
his
heart
he
endured
anguish
at
that
moment
and
if
it
had
been
possible
to
slay
raskolnikov
instantly
by
wishing
it
pyotr
petrovitch
would
promptly
have
uttered
the
wish
it
wa
my
mistake
too
not
to
have
given
them
money
he
thought
a
he
returned
dejectedly
to
lebeziatnikov
s
room
and
why
on
earth
wa
i
such
a
jew
it
wa
false
economy
i
meant
to
keep
them
without
a
penny
so
that
they
should
turn
to
me
a
their
providence
and
look
at
them
foo
if
i
d
spent
some
fifteen
hundred
rouble
on
them
for
the
trousseau
and
present
on
jewellery
material
and
all
that
sort
of
trash
from
knopp
s
and
the
english
shop
my
position
would
have
been
better
and
stronger
they
could

easily
they
are
the
sort
of
people
that
would
feel
bound
to
return
money
and
present
if
they
broke
it
off
and
they
would
find
it
hard
to
do
it
and
their
conscience
would
prick
them
how
can
we
dismiss
a
man
who

so
generous
and
delicate

grinding
his
teeth

pyotr
petrovitch
called
himself
a
fool
but
not
aloud
of
course
he
returned
home
twice
a
irritated
and
angry
a
before
the
preparation
for
the
funeral
dinner
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
excited
his
curiosity
a
he
passed
he
had
heard
about
it
the
day
before
he
fancied
indeed
that
he
had
been
invited
but
absorbed
in
his
own
care
he
had
paid
no
attention
inquiring
of
madame
lippevechsel
who
wa
busy
laying
the
table
while
katerina
ivanovna
wa
away
at
the
cemetery
he
heard
that
the
entertainment
wa
to
be
a
great
affair
that
all
the
lodger
had
been
invited
among
them
some
who
had
not
known
the
dead
man
that
even
andrey
semyonovitch
lebeziatnikov
wa
invited
in
spite
of
his
previous
quarrel
with
katerina
ivanovna
that
he
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
not
only
invited
but
wa
eagerly
expected
a
he
wa
the
most
important
of
the
lodger
amalia
ivanovna
herself
had
been
invited
with
great
ceremony
in
spite
of
the
recent
unpleasantness
and
so
she
wa
very
busy
with
preparation
and
wa
taking
a
positive
pleasure
in
them
she
wa
moreover
dressed
up
to
the
nine
all
in
new
black
silk
and
she
wa
proud
of
it
all
this
suggested
an
idea
to
pyotr
petrovitch
and
he
went
into
his
room
or
rather
lebeziatnikov
s
somewhat
thoughtful
he
had
learnt
that
raskolnikov
wa
to
be
one
of
the
guest
andrey
semyonovitch
had
been
at
home
all
the
morning
the
attitude
of
pyotr
petrovitch
to
this
gentleman
wa
strange
though
perhaps
natural
pyotr
petrovitch
had
despised
and
hated
him
from
the
day
he
came
to
stay
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
somewhat
afraid
of
him
he
had
not
come
to
stay
with
him
on
his
arrival
in
petersburg
simply
from
parsimony
though
that
had
been
perhaps
his
chief
object
he
had
heard
of
andrey
semyonovitch
who
had
once
been
his
ward
a
a
leading
young
progressive
who
wa
taking
an
important
part
in
certain
interesting
circle
the
doings
of
which
were
a
legend
in
the
province
it
had
impressed
pyotr
petrovitch
these
powerful
omniscient
circle
who
despised
everyone
and
showed
everyone
up
had
long
inspired
in
him
a
peculiar
but
quite
vague
alarm
he
had
not
of
course
been
able
to
form
even
an
approximate
notion
of
what
they
meant
he
like
everyone
had
heard
that
there
were
especially
in
petersburg
progressive
of
some
sort
nihilist
and
so
on
and
like
many
people
he
exaggerated
and
distorted
the
significance
of
those
word
to
an
absurd
degree
what
for
many
year
past
he
had
feared
more
than
anything
wa
shown
and
this
wa
the
chief
ground
for
his
continual
uneasiness
at
the
thought
of
transferring
his
business
to
petersburg
he
wa
afraid
of
this
a
little
child
are
sometimes
some
year
before
when
he
wa
just
entering
on
his
own
career
he
had
come
upon
two
case
in
which
rather
important
personage
in
the
province
patron
of
his
had
been
cruelly
shown
up
one
instance
had
ended
in
great
scandal
for
the
person
attacked
and
the
other
had
very
nearly
ended
in
serious
trouble
for
this
reason
pyotr
petrovitch
intended
to
go
into
the
subject
a
soon
a
he
reached
petersburg
and
if
necessary
to
anticipate
contingency
by
seeking
the
favour
of
our
younger
he
relied
on
andrey
semyonovitch
for
this
and
before
his
visit
to
raskolnikov
he
had
succeeded
in
picking
up
some
current
phrase
he
soon
discovered
that
andrey
semyonovitch
wa
a
commonplace
simpleton
but
that
by
no
mean
reassured
pyotr
petrovitch
even
if
he
had
been
certain
that
all
the
progressive
were
fool
like
him
it
would
not
have
allayed
his
uneasiness
all
the
doctrine
the
idea
the
system
with
which
andrey
semyonovitch
pestered
him
had
no
interest
for
him
he
had
his
own
object
he
simply
wanted
to
find
out
at
once
what
wa
happening
had
these
people
any
power
or
not
had
he
anything
to
fear
from
them
would
they
expose
any
enterprise
of
his
and
what
precisely
wa
now
the
object
of
their
attack
could
he
somehow
make
up
to
them
and
get
round
them
if
they
really
were
powerful
wa
this
the
thing
to
do
or
not
couldn
t
he
gain
something
through
them
in
fact
hundred
of
question
presented
themselves
andrey
semyonovitch
wa
an
anæmic
scrofulous
little
man
with
strangely
flaxen
whisker
of
which
he
wa
very
proud
he
wa
a
clerk
and
had
almost
always
something
wrong
with
his
eye
he
wa
rather
but
and
sometimes
extremely
conceited
in
speech
which
had
an
absurd
effect
incongruous
with
his
little
figure
he
wa
one
of
the
lodger
most
respected
by
amalia
ivanovna
for
he
did
not
get
drunk
and
paid
regularly
for
his
lodging
andrey
semyonovitch
really
wa
rather
stupid
he
attached
himself
to
the
cause
of
progress
and
our
younger
generation
from
enthusiasm
he
wa
one
of
the
numerous
and
varied
legion
of
dullard
of
abortion
conceited
coxcomb
who
attach
themselves
to
the
idea
most
in
fashion
only
to
vulgarise
it
and
who
caricature
every
cause
they
serve
however
sincerely
though
lebeziatnikov
wa
so
he
too
wa
beginning
to
dislike
pyotr
petrovitch
this
happened
on
both
side
unconsciously
however
simple
andrey
semyonovitch
might
be
he
began
to
see
that
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
duping
him
and
secretly
despising
him
and
that
he
wa
not
the
right
sort
of
he
had
tried
expounding
to
him
the
system
of
fourier
and
the
darwinian
theory
but
of
late
pyotr
petrovitch
began
to
listen
too
sarcastically
and
even
to
be
rude
the
fact
wa
he
had
begun
instinctively
to
guess
that
lebeziatnikov
wa
not
merely
a
commonplace
simpleton
but
perhaps
a
liar
too
and
that
he
had
no
connection
of
any
consequence
even
in
his
own
circle
but
had
simply
picked
thing
up
and
that
very
likely
he
did
not
even
know
much
about
his
own
work
of
propaganda
for
he
wa
in
too
great
a
muddle
a
fine
person
he
would
be
to
show
anyone
up
it
must
be
noted
by
the
way
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
during
those
ten
day
eagerly
accepted
the
strangest
praise
from
andrey
semyonovitch
he
had
not
protested
for
instance
when
andrey
semyonovitch
belauded
him
for
being
ready
to
contribute
to
the
establishment
of
the
new
commune
or
to
abstain
from
christening
his
future
child
or
to
acquiesce
if
dounia
were
to
take
a
lover
a
month
after
marriage
and
so
on
pyotr
petrovitch
so
enjoyed
hearing
his
own
praise
that
he
did
not
disdain
even
such
virtue
when
they
were
attributed
to
him
pyotr
petrovitch
had
had
occasion
that
morning
to
realise
some
bond
and
now
he
sat
down
to
the
table
and
counted
over
bundle
of
note
andrey
semyonovitch
who
hardly
ever
had
any
money
walked
about
the
room
pretending
to
himself
to
look
at
all
those
bank
note
with
indifference
and
even
contempt
nothing
would
have
convinced
pyotr
petrovitch
that
andrey
semyonovitch
could
really
look
on
the
money
unmoved
and
the
latter
on
his
side
kept
thinking
bitterly
that
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
capable
of
entertaining
such
an
idea
about
him
and
wa
perhaps
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
teasing
his
young
friend
by
reminding
him
of
his
inferiority
and
the
great
difference
between
them
he
found
him
incredibly
inattentive
and
irritable
though
he
andrey
semyonovitch
began
enlarging
on
his
favourite
subject
the
foundation
of
a
new
special
the
brief
remark
that
dropped
from
pyotr
petrovitch
between
the
clicking
of
the
bead
on
the
reckoning
frame
betrayed
unmistakable
and
discourteous
irony
but
the
humane
andrey
semyonovitch
ascribed
pyotr
petrovitch
s
to
his
recent
breach
with
dounia
and
he
wa
burning
with
impatience
to
discourse
on
that
theme
he
had
something
progressive
to
say
on
the
subject
which
might
console
his
worthy
friend
and
could
not
fail
to
promote
his
development
there
is
some
sort
of
festivity
being
prepared
at
that
at
the
widow
s
isn
t
there
pyotr
petrovitch
asked
suddenly
interrupting
andrey
semyonovitch
at
the
most
interesting
passage
why
don
t
you
know
why
i
wa
telling
you
last
night
what
i
think
about
all
such
ceremony
and
she
invited
you
too
i
heard
you
were
talking
to
her
yesterday
i
should
never
have
expected
that
beggarly
fool
would
have
spent
on
this
feast
all
the
money
she
got
from
that
other
fool
raskolnikov
i
wa
surprised
just
now
a
i
came
through
at
the
preparation
there
the
wine
several
people
are
invited
it
s
beyond
everything
continued
pyotr
petrovitch
who
seemed
to
have
some
object
in
pursuing
the
conversation
what
you
say
i
am
asked
too
when
wa
that
i
don
t
remember
but
i
shan
t
go
why
should
i
i
only
said
a
word
to
her
in
passing
yesterday
of
the
possibility
of
her
obtaining
a
year
s
salary
a
a
destitute
widow
of
a
government
clerk
i
suppose
she
ha
invited
me
on
that
account
hasn
t
she
i
don
t
intend
to
go
either
said
lebeziatnikov
i
should
think
not
after
giving
her
a
thrashing
you
might
well
hesitate
who
thrashed
whom
cried
lebeziatnikov
flustered
and
blushing
why
you
thrashed
katerina
ivanovna
a
month
ago
i
heard
so
yesterday
so
that
s
what
your
conviction
amount
to
and
the
woman
question
too
wasn
t
quite
sound
and
pyotr
petrovitch
a
though
comforted
went
back
to
clicking
his
bead
it
s
all
slander
and
nonsense
cried
lebeziatnikov
who
wa
always
afraid
of
allusion
to
the
subject
it
wa
not
like
that
at
all
it
wa
quite
different
you
ve
heard
it
wrong
it
s
a
libel
i
wa
simply
defending
myself
she
rushed
at
me
first
with
her
nail
she
pulled
out
all
my
whisker
it
s
permissable
for
anyone
i
should
hope
to
defend
himself
and
i
never
allow
anyone
to
use
violence
to
me
on
principle
for
it
s
an
act
of
despotism
what
wa
i
to
do
i
simply
pushed
her
luzhin
went
on
laughing
maliciously
you
keep
on
like
that
because
you
are
out
of
humour
yourself
but
that
s
nonsense
and
it
ha
nothing
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
woman
question
you
don
t
understand
i
used
to
think
indeed
that
if
woman
are
equal
to
men
in
all
respect
even
in
strength
a
is
maintained
now
there
ought
to
be
equality
in
that
too
of
course
i
reflected
afterwards
that
such
a
question
ought
not
really
to
arise
for
there
ought
not
to
be
fighting
and
in
the
future
society
fighting
is
unthinkable
and
that
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
to
seek
for
equality
in
fighting
i
am
not
so
stupid
though
of
course
there
is
fighting
there
won
t
be
later
but
at
present
there
is
confound
it
how
muddled
one
get
with
you
it
s
not
on
that
account
that
i
am
not
going
i
am
not
going
on
principle
not
to
take
part
in
the
revolting
convention
of
memorial
dinner
that
s
why
though
of
course
one
might
go
to
laugh
at
it
i
am
sorry
there
won
t
be
any
priest
at
it
i
should
certainly
go
if
there
then
you
would
sit
down
at
another
man
s
table
and
insult
it
and
those
who
invited
you
eh
certainly
not
insult
but
protest
i
should
do
it
with
a
good
object
i
might
indirectly
assist
the
cause
of
enlightenment
and
propaganda
it
s
a
duty
of
every
man
to
work
for
enlightenment
and
propaganda
and
the
more
harshly
perhaps
the
better
i
might
drop
a
seed
an
idea
and
something
might
grow
up
from
that
seed
how
should
i
be
insulting
them
they
might
be
offended
at
first
but
afterwards
they
d
see
i
d
done
them
a
service
you
know
terebyeva
who
is
in
the
community
now
wa
blamed
because
when
she
left
her
family
and
devoted
herself
she
wrote
to
her
father
and
mother
that
she
wouldn
t
go
on
living
conventionally
and
wa
entering
on
a
free
marriage
and
it
wa
said
that
that
wa
too
harsh
that
she
might
have
spared
them
and
have
written
more
kindly
i
think
that
s
all
nonsense
and
there
s
no
need
of
softness
on
the
contrary
what
s
wanted
is
protest
varents
had
been
married
seven
year
she
abandoned
her
two
child
she
told
her
husband
straight
out
in
a
letter
i
have
realised
that
i
can
not
be
happy
with
you
i
can
never
forgive
you
that
you
have
deceived
me
by
concealing
from
me
that
there
is
another
organisation
of
society
by
mean
of
the
community
i
have
only
lately
learned
it
from
a
man
to
whom
i
have
given
myself
and
with
whom
i
am
establishing
a
community
i
speak
plainly
because
i
consider
it
dishonest
to
deceive
you
do
a
you
think
best
do
not
hope
to
get
me
back
you
are
too
late
i
hope
you
will
be
that
s
how
letter
like
that
ought
to
be
written
is
that
terebyeva
the
one
you
said
had
made
a
third
free
marriage
no
it
s
only
the
second
really
but
what
if
it
were
the
fourth
what
if
it
were
the
fifteenth
that
s
all
nonsense
and
if
ever
i
regretted
the
death
of
my
father
and
mother
it
is
now
and
i
sometimes
think
if
my
parent
were
living
what
a
protest
i
would
have
aimed
at
them
i
would
have
done
something
on
purpose
i
would
have
shown
them
i
would
have
astonished
them
i
am
really
sorry
there
is
no
one
to
surprise
well
be
that
a
you
will
pyotr
petrovitch
interrupted
but
tell
me
this
do
you
know
the
dead
man
s
daughter
the
little
thing
it
s
true
what
they
say
about
her
isn
t
it
what
of
it
i
think
that
is
it
is
my
own
personal
conviction
that
this
is
the
normal
condition
of
woman
why
not
i
mean
in
our
present
society
it
is
not
altogether
normal
because
it
is
compulsory
but
in
the
future
society
it
will
be
perfectly
normal
because
it
will
be
voluntary
even
a
it
is
she
wa
quite
right
she
wa
suffering
and
that
wa
her
asset
so
to
speak
her
capital
which
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
dispose
of
of
course
in
the
future
society
there
will
be
no
need
of
asset
but
her
part
will
have
another
significance
rational
and
in
harmony
with
her
environment
a
to
sofya
semyonovna
personally
i
regard
her
action
a
a
vigorous
protest
against
the
organisation
of
society
and
i
respect
her
deeply
for
it
i
rejoice
indeed
when
i
look
at
her
i
wa
told
that
you
got
her
turned
out
of
these
lebeziatnikov
wa
enraged
that
s
another
slander
he
yelled
it
wa
not
so
at
all
that
wa
all
katerina
ivanovna
s
invention
for
she
did
not
understand
and
i
never
made
love
to
sofya
semyonovna
i
wa
simply
developing
her
entirely
disinterestedly
trying
to
rouse
her
to
protest
all
i
wanted
wa
her
protest
and
sofya
semyonovna
could
not
have
remained
here
anyway
have
you
asked
her
to
join
your
community
you
keep
on
laughing
and
very
inappropriately
allow
me
to
tell
you
you
don
t
understand
there
is
no
such
rôle
in
a
community
the
community
is
established
that
there
should
be
no
such
rôles
in
a
community
such
a
rôle
is
essentially
transformed
and
what
is
stupid
here
is
sensible
there
what
under
present
condition
is
unnatural
becomes
perfectly
natural
in
the
community
it
all
depends
on
the
environment
it
s
all
the
environment
and
man
himself
is
nothing
and
i
am
on
good
term
with
sofya
semyonovna
to
this
day
which
is
a
proof
that
she
never
regarded
me
a
having
wronged
her
i
am
trying
now
to
attract
her
to
the
community
but
on
quite
quite
a
different
footing
what
are
you
laughing
at
we
are
trying
to
establish
a
community
of
our
own
a
special
one
on
a
broader
basis
we
have
gone
further
in
our
conviction
we
reject
more
and
meanwhile
i
m
still
developing
sofya
semyonovna
she
ha
a
beautiful
beautiful
character
and
you
take
advantage
of
her
fine
character
eh
no
no
oh
no
on
the
oh
on
the
contrary
a
queer
thing
to
say
believe
me
why
should
i
disguise
it
in
fact
i
feel
it
strange
myself
how
timid
chaste
and
modern
she
is
with
me
and
you
of
course
are
developing
her
trying
to
prove
to
her
that
all
that
modesty
is
nonsense
not
at
all
not
at
all
how
coarsely
how
stupidly
excuse
me
saying
so
you
misunderstand
the
word
development
good
heaven
how
crude
you
still
are
we
are
striving
for
the
freedom
of
woman
and
you
have
only
one
idea
in
your
head
setting
aside
the
general
question
of
chastity
and
feminine
modesty
a
useless
in
themselves
and
indeed
prejudice
i
fully
accept
her
chastity
with
me
because
that
s
for
her
to
decide
of
course
if
she
were
to
tell
me
herself
that
she
wanted
me
i
should
think
myself
very
lucky
because
i
like
the
girl
very
much
but
a
it
is
no
one
ha
ever
treated
her
more
courteously
than
i
with
more
respect
for
her
dignity
i
wait
in
hope
that
s
all
you
had
much
better
make
her
a
present
of
something
i
bet
you
never
thought
of
you
don
t
understand
a
i
ve
told
you
already
of
course
she
is
in
such
a
position
but
it
s
another
question
quite
another
question
you
simply
despise
her
seeing
a
fact
which
you
mistakenly
consider
deserving
of
contempt
you
refuse
to
take
a
humane
view
of
a
fellow
creature
you
don
t
know
what
a
character
she
is
i
am
only
sorry
that
of
late
she
ha
quite
given
up
reading
and
borrowing
book
i
used
to
lend
them
to
her
i
am
sorry
too
that
with
all
the
energy
and
resolution
in
protesting
which
she
ha
already
shown
once
she
ha
little
little
so
to
say
independence
so
a
to
break
free
from
certain
prejudice
and
certain
foolish
idea
yet
she
thoroughly
understands
some
question
for
instance
about
kissing
of
hand
that
is
that
it
s
an
insult
to
a
woman
for
a
man
to
kiss
her
hand
because
it
s
a
sign
of
inequality
we
had
a
debate
about
it
and
i
described
it
to
her
she
listened
attentively
to
an
account
of
the
workman
s
association
in
france
too
now
i
am
explaining
the
question
of
coming
into
the
room
in
the
future
and
what
s
that
pray
we
had
a
debate
lately
on
the
question
ha
a
member
of
the
community
the
right
to
enter
another
member
s
room
whether
man
or
woman
at
any
time
and
we
decided
that
he
ha
it
might
be
at
an
inconvenient
moment
lebeziatnikov
wa
really
angry
you
are
always
thinking
of
something
unpleasant
he
cried
with
aversion
tfoo
how
vexed
i
am
that
when
i
wa
expounding
our
system
i
referred
prematurely
to
the
question
of
personal
privacy
it
s
always
a
to
people
like
you
they
turn
it
into
ridicule
before
they
understand
it
and
how
proud
they
are
of
it
too
tfoo
i
ve
often
maintained
that
that
question
should
not
be
approached
by
a
novice
till
he
ha
a
firm
faith
in
the
system
and
tell
me
please
what
do
you
find
so
shameful
even
in
cesspool
i
should
be
the
first
to
be
ready
to
clean
out
any
cesspool
you
like
and
it
s
not
a
question
of
it
s
simply
work
honourable
useful
work
which
is
a
good
a
any
other
and
much
better
than
the
work
of
a
raphael
and
a
pushkin
because
it
is
more
and
more
honourable
more
honourable
what
do
you
mean
by
more
honourable
i
don
t
understand
such
expression
to
describe
human
activity
more
honourable
nobler
all
those
are
prejudice
which
i
reject
everything
which
is
to
mankind
is
honourable
i
only
understand
one
word
you
can
snigger
a
much
a
you
like
but
that
s
so
pyotr
petrovitch
laughed
heartily
he
had
finished
counting
the
money
and
wa
putting
it
away
but
some
of
the
note
he
left
on
the
table
the
cesspool
question
had
already
been
a
subject
of
dispute
between
them
what
wa
absurd
wa
that
it
made
lebeziatnikov
really
angry
while
it
amused
luzhin
and
at
that
moment
he
particularly
wanted
to
anger
his
young
friend
it
s
your
yesterday
that
make
you
so
and
annoying
blurted
out
lebeziatnikov
who
in
spite
of
his
independence
and
his
protest
did
not
venture
to
oppose
pyotr
petrovitch
and
still
behaved
to
him
with
some
of
the
respect
habitual
in
earlier
year
you
d
better
tell
me
this
pyotr
petrovitch
interrupted
with
haughty
displeasure
can
you
or
rather
are
you
really
friendly
enough
with
that
young
person
to
ask
her
to
step
in
here
for
a
minute
i
think
they
ve
all
come
back
from
the
cemetery
i
heard
the
sound
of
step
i
want
to
see
her
that
young
what
for
lebeziatnikov
asked
with
surprise
oh
i
want
to
i
am
leaving
here
or
and
therefore
i
wanted
to
speak
to
her
about
however
you
may
be
present
during
the
interview
it
s
better
you
should
be
indeed
for
there
s
no
knowing
what
you
might
i
shan
t
imagine
anything
i
only
asked
and
if
you
ve
anything
to
say
to
her
nothing
is
easier
than
to
call
her
in
i
ll
go
directly
and
you
may
be
sure
i
won
t
be
in
your
five
minute
later
lebeziatnikov
came
in
with
sonia
she
came
in
very
much
surprised
and
overcome
with
shyness
a
usual
she
wa
always
shy
in
such
circumstance
and
wa
always
afraid
of
new
people
she
had
been
a
a
child
and
wa
even
more
so
now
pyotr
petrovitch
met
her
politely
and
affably
but
with
a
certain
shade
of
bantering
familiarity
which
in
his
opinion
wa
suitable
for
a
man
of
his
respectability
and
weight
in
dealing
with
a
creature
so
young
and
so
a
she
he
hastened
to
reassure
her
and
made
her
sit
down
facing
him
at
the
table
sonia
sat
down
looked
about
her
at
lebeziatnikov
at
the
note
lying
on
the
table
and
then
again
at
pyotr
petrovitch
and
her
eye
remained
riveted
on
him
lebeziatnikov
wa
moving
to
the
door
pyotr
petrovitch
signed
to
sonia
to
remain
seated
and
stopped
lebeziatnikov
is
raskolnikov
in
there
ha
he
come
he
asked
him
in
a
whisper
raskolnikov
yes
why
yes
he
is
there
i
saw
him
just
come
in
why
well
i
particularly
beg
you
to
remain
here
with
u
and
not
to
leave
me
alone
with
this
young
woman
i
only
want
a
few
word
with
her
but
god
know
what
they
may
make
of
it
i
shouldn
t
like
raskolnikov
to
repeat
anything
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
understand
lebeziatnikov
saw
the
point
yes
you
are
right
of
course
i
am
convinced
personally
that
you
have
no
reason
to
be
uneasy
but
still
you
are
right
certainly
i
ll
stay
i
ll
stand
here
at
the
window
and
not
be
in
your
way
i
think
you
are
right
pyotr
petrovitch
returned
to
the
sofa
sat
down
opposite
sonia
looked
attentively
at
her
and
assumed
an
extremely
dignified
even
severe
expression
a
much
a
to
say
don
t
you
make
any
mistake
sonia
wa
overwhelmed
with
embarrassment
in
the
first
place
sofya
semyonovna
will
you
make
my
excuse
to
your
respected
mamma
that
s
right
isn

it
katerina
ivanovna
stand
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
you
pyotr
petrovitch
began
with
great
dignity
though
affably
it
wa
evident
that
his
intention
were
friendly
quite
so
yes
the
place
of
a
mother
sonia
answered
timidly
and
hurriedly
then
will
you
make
my
apology
to
her
through
inevitable
circumstance
i
am
forced
to
be
absent
and
shall
not
be
at
the
dinner
in
spite
of
your
mamma
s
kind
yes
i
ll
tell
her
at
and
sonia
hastily
jumped
up
from
her
seat
wait
that
s
not
all
pyotr
petrovitch
detained
her
smiling
at
her
simplicity
and
ignorance
of
good
manner
and
you
know
me
little
my
dear
sofya
semyonovna
if
you
suppose
i
would
have
ventured
to
trouble
a
person
like
you
for
a
matter
of
so
little
consequence
affecting
myself
only
i
have
another
sonia
sat
down
hurriedly
her
eye
rested
again
for
an
instant
on
the
note
that
remained
on
the
table
but
she
quickly
looked
away
and
fixed
her
eye
on
pyotr
petrovitch
she
felt
it
horribly
indecorous
especially
for
to
look
at
another
person
s
money
she
stared
at
the
gold
which
pyotr
petrovitch
held
in
his
left
hand
and
at
the
massive
and
extremely
handsome
ring
with
a
yellow
stone
on
his
middle
finger
but
suddenly
she
looked
away
and
not
knowing
where
to
turn
ended
by
staring
pyotr
petrovitch
again
straight
in
the
face
after
a
pause
of
still
greater
dignity
he
continued
i
chanced
yesterday
in
passing
to
exchange
a
couple
of
word
with
katerina
ivanovna
poor
woman
that
wa
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
ascertain
that
she
is
in
a
position
preternatural
if
one
may
so
express
yes
preternatural
sonia
hurriedly
assented
or
it
would
be
simpler
and
more
comprehensible
to
say
yes
simpler
and
more
comprehen
yes
quite
so
so
then
from
a
feeling
of
humanity
and
so
to
speak
compassion
i
should
be
glad
to
be
of
service
to
her
in
any
way
foreseeing
her
unfortunate
position
i
believe
the
whole
of
this
family
depends
now
entirely
on
you
allow
me
to
ask
sonia
rose
to
her
foot
did
you
say
something
to
her
yesterday
of
the
possibility
of
a
pension
because
she
told
me
you
had
undertaken
to
get
her
one
wa
that
true
not
in
the
slightest
and
indeed
it
s
an
absurdity
i
merely
hinted
at
her
obtaining
temporary
assistance
a
the
widow
of
an
official
who
had
died
in
the
service
if
only
she
ha
patronage
but
apparently
your
late
parent
had
not
served
his
full
term
and
had
not
indeed
been
in
the
service
at
all
of
late
in
fact
if
there
could
be
any
hope
it
would
be
very
ephemeral
because
there
would
be
no
claim
for
assistance
in
that
case
far
from
it
and
she
is
dreaming
of
a
pension
already
a
lady
yes
she
is
for
she
is
credulous
and
and
she
belief
everything
from
the
goodness
of
her
heart
and
and
and
she
is
like
that
yes
you
must
excuse
her
said
sonia
and
again
she
got
up
to
go
but
you
haven
t
heard
what
i
have
to
no
i
haven
t
heard
muttered
sonia
then
sit
she
wa
terribly
confused
she
sat
down
again
a
third
time
seeing
her
position
with
her
unfortunate
little
one
i
should
be
glad
a
i
have
said
before
so
far
a
lie
in
my
power
to
be
of
service
that
is
so
far
a
is
in
my
power
not
more
one
might
for
instance
get
up
a
subscription
for
her
or
a
lottery
something
of
the
sort
such
a
is
always
arranged
in
such
case
by
friend
or
even
outsider
desirous
of
assisting
people
it
wa
of
that
i
intended
to
speak
to
you
it
might
be
yes
yes
god
will
repay
you
for
it
faltered
sonia
gazing
intently
at
pyotr
petrovitch
it
might
be
but
we
will
talk
of
it
later
we
might
begin
it
we
will
talk
it
over
this
evening
and
lay
the
foundation
so
to
speak
come
to
me
at
seven
o
clock
lebeziatnikov
i
hope
will
assist
u
but
there
is
one
circumstance
of
which
i
ought
to
warn
you
beforehand
and
for
which
i
venture
to
trouble
you
sofya
semyonovna
to
come
here
in
my
opinion
money
can
not
be
indeed
it
s
unsafe
to
put
it
into
katerina
ivanovna
s
own
hand
the
dinner
is
a
proof
of
that
though
she
ha
not
so
to
speak
a
crust
of
bread
for
and
well
boot
or
shoe
or
anything
she
ha
bought
jamaica
rum
and
even
i
believe
madeira
and
and
coffee
i
saw
it
a
i
passed
through
it
will
all
fall
upon
you
again
they
won
t
have
a
crust
of
bread
it
s
absurd
really
and
so
to
my
thinking
a
subscription
ought
to
be
raised
so
that
the
unhappy
widow
should
not
know
of
the
money
but
only
you
for
instance
am
i
right
i
don
t
know
this
is
only
once
in
her
life
she
wa
so
anxious
to
do
honour
to
celebrate
the
memory
and
she
is
very
sensible
but
just
a
you
think
and
i
shall
be
very
very
they
will
all
be
and
god
will
reward
and
the
orphan
sonia
burst
into
tear
very
well
then
keep
it
in
mind
and
now
will
you
accept
for
the
benefit
of
your
relation
the
small
sum
that
i
am
able
to
spare
from
me
personally
i
am
very
anxious
that
my
name
should
not
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
it
here
having
so
to
speak
anxiety
of
my
own
i
can
not
do
more
and
pyotr
petrovitch
held
out
to
sonia
a
note
carefully
unfolded
sonia
took
it
flushed
crimson
jumped
up
muttered
something
and
began
taking
leave
pyotr
petrovitch
accompanied
her
ceremoniously
to
the
door
she
got
out
of
the
room
at
last
agitated
and
distressed
and
returned
to
katerina
ivanovna
overwhelmed
with
confusion
all
this
time
lebeziatnikov
had
stood
at
the
window
or
walked
about
the
room
anxious
not
to
interrupt
the
conversation
when
sonia
had
gone
he
walked
up
to
pyotr
petrovitch
and
solemnly
held
out
his
hand
i
heard
and
everything
he
said
laying
stress
on
the
last
verb
that
is
honourable
i
mean
to
say
it
s
humane
you
wanted
to
avoid
gratitude
i
saw
and
although
i
can
not
i
confess
in
principle
sympathise
with
private
charity
for
it
not
only
fails
to
eradicate
the
evil
but
even
promotes
it
yet
i
must
admit
that
i
saw
your
action
with
pleasure
yes
yes
i
like
that
s
all
nonsense
muttered
pyotr
petrovitch
somewhat
disconcerted
looking
carefully
at
lebeziatnikov
no
it
s
not
nonsense
a
man
who
ha
suffered
distress
and
annoyance
a
you
did
yesterday
and
who
yet
can
sympathise
with
the
misery
of
others
such
a
man
even
though
he
is
making
a
social
mistake
is
still
deserving
of
respect
i
did
not
expect
it
indeed
of
you
pyotr
petrovitch
especially
a
according
to
your
idea
oh
what
a
drawback
your
idea
are
to
you
how
distressed
you
are
for
instance
by
your
yesterday
cried
the
lebeziatnikov
who
felt
a
return
of
affection
for
pyotr
petrovitch
and
what
do
you
want
with
marriage
with
marriage
my
dear
noble
pyotr
petrovitch
why
do
you
cling
to
this
of
marriage
well
you
may
beat
me
if
you
like
but
i
am
glad
positively
glad
it
hasn
t
come
off
that
you
are
free
that
you
are
not
quite
lost
for
humanity
you
see
i
ve
spoken
my
mind
because
i
don
t
want
in
your
free
marriage
to
be
made
a
fool
of
and
to
bring
up
another
man
s
child
that
s
why
i
want
legal
marriage
luzhin
replied
in
order
to
make
some
answer
he
seemed
preoccupied
by
something
child
you
referred
to
child
lebeziatnikov
started
off
like
a
warhorse
at
the
trumpet
call
child
are
a
social
question
and
a
question
of
first
importance
i
agree
but
the
question
of
child
ha
another
solution
some
refuse
to
have
child
altogether
because
they
suggest
the
institution
of
the
family
we
ll
speak
of
child
later
but
now
a
to
the
question
of
honour
i
confess
that
s
my
weak
point
that
horrid
military
pushkin
expression
is
unthinkable
in
the
dictionary
of
the
future
what
doe
it
mean
indeed
it
s
nonsense
there
will
be
no
deception
in
a
free
marriage
that
is
only
the
natural
consequence
of
a
legal
marriage
so
to
say
it
corrective
a
protest
so
that
indeed
it
s
not
humiliating
and
if
i
ever
to
suppose
an
absurdity
were
to
be
legally
married
i
should
be
positively
glad
of
it
i
should
say
to
my
wife
my
dear
hitherto
i
have
loved
you
now
i
respect
you
for
you
ve
shown
you
can
protest
you
laugh
that
s
because
you
are
incapable
of
getting
away
from
prejudice
confound
it
all
i
understand
now
where
the
unpleasantness
is
of
being
deceived
in
a
legal
marriage
but
it
s
simply
a
despicable
consequence
of
a
despicable
position
in
which
both
are
humiliated
when
the
deception
is
open
a
in
a
free
marriage
then
it
doe
not
exist
it
s
unthinkable
your
wife
will
only
prove
how
she
respect
you
by
considering
you
incapable
of
opposing
her
happiness
and
avenging
yourself
on
her
for
her
new
husband
damn
it
all
i
sometimes
dream
if
i
were
to
be
married
pfoo
i
mean
if
i
were
to
marry
legally
or
not
it
s
just
the
same
i
should
present
my
wife
with
a
lover
if
she
had
not
found
one
for
herself
my
dear
i
should
say
i
love
you
but
even
more
than
that
i
desire
you
to
respect
me
see
am
i
not
right
pyotr
petrovitch
sniggered
a
he
listened
but
without
much
merriment
he
hardly
heard
it
indeed
he
wa
preoccupied
with
something
else
and
even
lebeziatnikov
at
last
noticed
it
pyotr
petrovitch
seemed
excited
and
rubbed
his
hand
lebeziatnikov
remembered
all
this
and
reflected
upon
it
afterwards
chapter
ii
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
exactly
what
could
have
originated
the
idea
of
that
senseless
dinner
in
katerina
ivanovna
s
disordered
brain
nearly
ten
of
the
twenty
rouble
given
by
raskolnikov
for
marmeladov
s
funeral
were
wasted
upon
it
possibly
katerina
ivanovna
felt
obliged
to
honour
the
memory
of
the
deceased
suitably
that
all
the
lodger
and
still
more
amalia
ivanovna
might
know
that
he
wa
in
no
way
their
inferior
and
perhaps
very
much
their
superior
and
that
no
one
had
the
right
to
turn
up
his
nose
at
perhaps
the
chief
element
wa
that
peculiar
poor
man
s
pride
which
compels
many
poor
people
to
spend
their
last
saving
on
some
traditional
social
ceremony
simply
in
order
to
do
like
other
people
and
not
to
be
looked
down
it
is
very
probable
too
that
katerina
ivanovna
longed
on
this
occasion
at
the
moment
when
she
seemed
to
be
abandoned
by
everyone
to
show
those
wretched
contemptible
lodger
that
she
knew
how
to
do
thing
how
to
entertain
and
that
she
had
been
brought
up
in
a
genteel

might
almost
say
aristocratic

family
and
had
not

and
washing
the
child

rag
at
night
even
the
poorest
and
most
people
are
sometimes
liable
to
these
paroxysm
of
pride
and
vanity
which
take
the
form
of
an
irresistible
nervous
craving
and
katerina

might
have

her

with
good
reason
that
her
mind

unhinged
she
could
not
be
said
to
be
insane
but
for
a
year
past
she
had
been

there
were
three
or
four
dish
one
of
which
consisted
of
pancake
all
prepared
in
amalia
ivanovna
s
kitchen
two
samovar
were
boiling
that
tea
and
punch
might
be
offered
after
dinner
katerina
ivanovna
had
herself
seen
to
purchasing
the
provision
with
the
help
of
one
of
the
lodger
an
unfortunate
little
pole
who
had
somehow
been
stranded
at
madame
lippevechsel
s
he
promptly
put
himself
at
katerina
ivanovna
s
disposal
and
had
been
all
that
morning
and
all
the
day
before
running
about
a
fast
a
his
leg
could
carry
him
and
very
anxious
that
everyone
should
be
aware
of
it
for
every
trifle
he
ran
to
katerina
ivanovna
even
hunting
her
out
at
the
bazaar
at
every
instant
called
her
she
wa
heartily
sick
of
him
before
the
end
though
she
had
declared
at
first
that
she
could
not
have
got
on
without
this
serviceable
and
magnanimous
it
wa
one
of
katerina
ivanovna
s
characteristic
to
paint
everyone
she
met
in
the
most
glowing
colour
her
praise
were
so
exaggerated
a
sometimes
to
be
embarrassing
she
would
invent
various
circumstance
to
the
credit
of
her
new
acquaintance
and
quite
genuinely
believe
in
their
reality
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
would
be
disillusioned
and
would
rudely
and
contemptuously
repulse
the
person
she
had
only
a
few
hour
before
been
literally
adoring
she
wa
naturally
of
a
gay
lively
and
disposition
but
from
continual
failure
and
misfortune
she
had
come
to
desire
so
that
all
should
live
in
peace
and
joy
and
should
not
to
break
the
peace
that
the
slightest
jar
the
smallest
disaster
reduced
her
almost
to
frenzy
and
she
would
pas
in
an
instant
from
the
brightest
hope
and
fancy
to
cursing
her
fate
and
raving
and
knocking
her
head
against
the
wall
amalia
ivanovna
too
suddenly
acquired
extraordinary
importance
in
katerina
ivanovna
s
eye
and
wa
treated
by
her
with
extraordinary
respect
probably
only
because
amalia
ivanovna
had
thrown
herself
heart
and
soul
into
the
preparation
she
had
undertaken
to
lay
the
table
to
provide
the
linen
crockery
and
to
cook
the
dish
in
her
kitchen
and
katerina
ivanovna
had
left
it
all
in
her
hand
and
gone
herself
to
the
cemetery
everything
had
been
well
done
even
the
wa
nearly
clean
the
crockery
knife
fork
and
glass
were
of
course
of
all
shape
and
pattern
lent
by
different
lodger
but
the
table
wa
properly
laid
at
the
time
fixed
and
amalia
ivanovna
feeling
she
had
done
her
work
well
had
put
on
a
black
silk
dress
and
a
cap
with
new
mourning
ribbon
and
met
the
returning
party
with
some
pride
this
pride
though
justifiable
displeased
katerina
ivanovna
for
some
reason
a
though
the
table
could
not
have
been
laid
except
by
amalia
ivanovna
she
disliked
the
cap
with
new
ribbon
too
could
she
be
stuck
up
the
stupid
german
because
she
wa
mistress
of
the
house
and
had
consented
a
a
favour
to
help
her
poor
lodger
a
a
favour
fancy
that
katerina
ivanovna
s
father
who
had
been
a
colonel
and
almost
a
governor
had
sometimes
had
the
table
set
for
forty
person
and
then
anyone
like
amalia
ivanovna
or
rather
ludwigovna
would
not
have
been
allowed
into
the
katerina
ivanovna
however
put
off
expressing
her
feeling
for
the
time
and
contented
herself
with
treating
her
coldly
though
she
decided
inwardly
that
she
would
certainly
have
to
put
amalia
ivanovna
down
and
set
her
in
her
proper
place
for
goodness
only
knew
what
she
wa
fancying
herself
katerina
ivanovna
wa
irritated
too
by
the
fact
that
hardly
any
of
the
lodger
invited
had
come
to
the
funeral
except
the
pole
who
had
just
managed
to
run
into
the
cemetery
while
to
the
memorial
dinner
the
poorest
and
most
insignificant
of
them
had
turned
up
the
wretched
creature
many
of
them
not
quite
sober
the
older
and
more
respectable
of
them
all
a
if
by
common
consent
stayed
away
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
for
instance
who
might
be
said
to
be
the
most
respectable
of
all
the
lodger
did
not
appear
though
katerina
ivanovna
had
the
evening
before
told
all
the
world
that
is
amalia
ivanovna
polenka
sonia
and
the
pole
that
he
wa
the
most
generous
man
with
a
large
property
and
vast
connection
who
had
been
a
friend
of
her
first
husband
s
and
a
guest
in
her
father
s
house
and
that
he
had
promised
to
use
all
his
influence
to
secure
her
a
considerable
pension
it
must
be
noted
that
when
katerina
ivanovna
exalted
anyone
s
connection
and
fortune
it
wa
without
any
ulterior
motive
quite
disinterestedly
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
adding
to
the
consequence
of
the
person
praised
probably
taking
his
cue
from
luzhin
that
contemptible
wretch
lebeziatnikov
had
not
turned
up
either
what
did
he
fancy
himself
he
wa
only
asked
out
of
kindness
and
because
he
wa
sharing
the
same
room
with
pyotr
petrovitch
and
wa
a
friend
of
his
so
that
it
would
have
been
awkward
not
to
invite
among
those
who
failed
to
appear
were
the
genteel
lady
and
her
daughter
who
had
only
been
lodger
in
the
house
for
the
last
fortnight
but
had
several
time
complained
of
the
noise
and
uproar
in
katerina
ivanovna
s
room
especially
when
marmeladov
had
come
back
drunk
katerina
ivanovna
heard
this
from
amalia
ivanovna
who
quarrelling
with
katerina
ivanovna
and
threatening
to
turn
the
whole
family
out
of
door
had
shouted
at
her
that
they
were
not
worth
the
foot
of
the
honourable
lodger
whom
they
were
disturbing
katerina
ivanovna
determined
now
to
invite
this
lady
and
her
daughter
whose
foot
she
wa
not
worth
and
who
had
turned
away
haughtily
when
she
casually
met
them
so
that
they
might
know
that
she
wa
more
noble
in
her
thought
and
feeling
and
did
not
harbour
malice
and
might
see
that
she
wa
not
accustomed
to
her
way
of
living
she
had
proposed
to
make
this
clear
to
them
at
dinner
with
allusion
to
her
late
father
s
governorship
and
also
at
the
same
time
to
hint
that
it
wa
exceedingly
stupid
of
them
to
turn
away
on
meeting
her
the
fat
he
wa
really
a
discharged
officer
of
low
rank
wa
also
absent
but
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
not
himself
for
the
last
two
day
the
party
consisted
of
the
pole
a
wretched
looking
clerk
with
a
spotty
face
and
a
greasy
coat
who
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
himself
and
smelt
abominably
a
deaf
and
almost
blind
old
man
who
had
once
been
in
the
post
office
and
who
had
been
from
immemorial
age
maintained
by
someone
at
amalia
ivanovna
s
a
retired
clerk
of
the
commissariat
department
came
too
he
wa
drunk
had
a
loud
and
most
unseemly
laugh
and
only
fancy
wa
without
a
waistcoat
one
of
the
visitor
sat
straight
down
to
the
table
without
even
greeting
katerina
ivanovna
finally
one
person
having
no
suit
appeared
in
his
but
this
wa
too
much
and
the
effort
of
amalia
ivanovna
and
the
pole
succeeded
in
removing
him
the
pole
brought
with
him
however
two
other
pole
who
did
not
live
at
amalia
ivanovna
s
and
whom
no
one
had
seen
here
before
all
this
irritated
katerina
ivanovna
intensely
for
whom
had
they
made
all
these
preparation
then
to
make
room
for
the
visitor
the
child
had
not
even
been
laid
for
at
the
table
but
the
two
little
one
were
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
furthest
corner
with
their
dinner
laid
on
a
box
while
polenka
a
a
big
girl
had
to
look
after
them
feed
them
and
keep
their
nose
wiped
like
child
s
katerina
ivanovna
in
fact
could
hardly
help
meeting
her
guest
with
increased
dignity
and
even
haughtiness
she
stared
at
some
of
them
with
special
severity
and
loftily
invited
them
to
take
their
seat
rushing
to
the
conclusion
that
amalia
ivanovna
must
be
responsible
for
those
who
were
absent
she
began
treating
her
with
extreme
nonchalance
which
the
latter
promptly
observed
and
resented
such
a
beginning
wa
no
good
omen
for
the
end
all
were
seated
at
last
raskolnikov
came
in
almost
at
the
moment
of
their
return
from
the
cemetery
katerina
ivanovna
wa
greatly
delighted
to
see
him
in
the
first
place
because
he
wa
the
one
educated
visitor
and
a
everyone
knew
wa
in
two
year
to
take
a
professorship
in
the
university
and
secondly
because
he
immediately
and
respectfully
apologised
for
having
been
unable
to
be
at
the
funeral
she
positively
pounced
upon
him
and
made
him
sit
on
her
left
hand
amalia
ivanovna
wa
on
her
right
in
spite
of
her
continual
anxiety
that
the
dish
should
be
passed
round
correctly
and
that
everyone
should
taste
them
in
spite
of
the
agonising
cough
which
interrupted
her
every
minute
and
seemed
to
have
grown
worse
during
the
last
few
day
she
hastened
to
pour
out
in
a
half
whisper
to
raskolnikov
all
her
suppressed
feeling
and
her
just
indignation
at
the
failure
of
the
dinner
interspersing
her
remark
with
lively
and
uncontrollable
laughter
at
the
expense
of
her
visitor
and
especially
of
her
landlady
it
s
all
that
cuckoo
s
fault
you
know
whom
i
mean
her
her
katerina
ivanovna
nodded
towards
the
landlady
look
at
her
she
s
making
round
eye
she
feel
that
we
are
talking
about
her
and
can
t
understand
pfoo
the
owl
and
what
doe
she
put
on
that
cap
for
have
you
noticed
that
she
want
everyone
to
consider
that
she
is
patronising
me
and
doing
me
an
honour
by
being
here
i
asked
her
like
a
sensible
woman
to
invite
people
especially
those
who
knew
my
late
husband
and
look
at
the
set
of
fool
she
ha
brought
the
sweep
look
at
that
one
with
the
spotty
face
and
those
wretched
pole
not
one
of
them
ha
ever
poked
his
nose
in
here
i
ve
never
set
eye
on
them
what
have
they
come
here
for
i
ask
you
there
they
sit
in
a
row
hey
she
cried
suddenly
to
one
of
them
have
you
tasted
the
pancake
take
some
more
have
some
beer
won
t
you
have
some
vodka
look
he
s
jumped
up
and
is
making
his
bow
they
must
be
quite
starved
poor
thing
never
mind
let
them
eat
they
don
t
make
a
noise
anyway
though
i
m
really
afraid
for
our
landlady
s
silver
spoon
amalia
ivanovna
she
addressed
her
suddenly
almost
aloud
if
your
spoon
should
happen
to
be
stolen
i
won
t
be
responsible
i
warn
you
she
laughed
turning
to
raskolnikov
and
again
nodding
towards
the
landlady
in
high
glee
at
her
sally
she
didn
t
understand
she
didn
t
understand
again
look
how
she
sits
with
her
mouth
open
an
owl
a
real
owl
an
owl
in
new
ribbon
here
her
laugh
turned
again
to
an
insufferable
fit
of
coughing
that
lasted
five
minute
drop
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
her
forehead
and
her
handkerchief
wa
stained
with
blood
she
showed
raskolnikov
the
blood
in
silence
and
a
soon
a
she
could
get
her
breath
began
whispering
to
him
again
with
extreme
animation
and
a
hectic
flush
on
her
cheek
do
you
know
i
gave
her
the
most
delicate
instruction
so
to
speak
for
inviting
that
lady
and
her
daughter
you
understand
of
whom
i
am
speaking
it
needed
the
utmost
delicacy
the
greatest
nicety
but
she
ha
managed
thing
so
that
that
fool
that
conceited
baggage
that
provincial
nonentity
simply
because
she
is
the
widow
of
a
major
and
ha
come
to
try
and
get
a
pension
and
to
fray
out
her
skirt
in
the
government
office
because
at
fifty
she
paint
her
face
everybody
know
it
a
creature
like
that
did
not
think
fit
to
come
and
ha
not
even
answered
the
invitation
which
the
most
ordinary
good
manner
required
i
can
t
understand
why
pyotr
petrovitch
ha
not
come
but
where
s
sonia
where
ha
she
gone
ah
there
she
is
at
last
what
is
it
sonia
where
have
you
been
it
s
odd
that
even
at
your
father
s
funeral
you
should
be
so
unpunctual
rodion
romanovitch
make
room
for
her
beside
you
that
s
your
place
sonia
take
what
you
like
have
some
of
the
cold
entrée
with
jelly
that
s
the
best
they
ll
bring
the
pancake
directly
have
they
given
the
child
some
polenka
have
you
got
everything
that
s
all
right
be
a
good
girl
lida
and
kolya
don
t
fidget
with
your
foot
sit
like
a
little
gentleman
what
are
you
saying
sonia
sonia
hastened
to
give
her
pyotr
petrovitch
s
apology
trying
to
speak
loud
enough
for
everyone
to
hear
and
carefully
choosing
the
most
respectful
phrase
which
she
attributed
to
pyotr
petrovitch
she
added
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
particularly
told
her
to
say
that
a
soon
a
he
possibly
could
he
would
come
immediately
to
discus
alone
with
her
and
to
consider
what
could
be
done
for
her
etc
sonia
knew
that
this
would
comfort
katerina
ivanovna
would
flatter
her
and
gratify
her
pride
she
sat
down
beside
raskolnikov
she
made
him
a
hurried
bow
glancing
curiously
at
him
but
for
the
rest
of
the
time
she
seemed
to
avoid
looking
at
him
or
speaking
to
him
she
seemed
though
she
kept
looking
at
katerina
ivanovna
trying
to
please
her
neither
she
nor
katerina
ivanovna
had
been
able
to
get
mourning
sonia
wa
wearing
dark
brown
and
katerina
ivanovna
had
on
her
only
dress
a
dark
striped
cotton
one
the
message
from
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
very
successful
listening
to
sonia
with
dignity
katerina
ivanovna
inquired
with
equal
dignity
how
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
then
at
once
whispered
almost
aloud
to
raskolnikov
that
it
certainly
would
have
been
strange
for
a
man
of
pyotr
petrovitch
s
position
and
standing
to
find
himself
in
such
extraordinary
company
in
spite
of
his
devotion
to
her
family
and
his
old
friendship
with
her
father
that
s
why
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
rodion
romanovitch
that
you
have
not
disdained
my
hospitality
even
in
such
surroundings
she
added
almost
aloud
but
i
am
sure
that
it
wa
only
your
special
affection
for
my
poor
husband
that
ha
made
you
keep
your
then
once
more
with
pride
and
dignity
she
scanned
her
visitor
and
suddenly
inquired
aloud
across
the
table
of
the
deaf
man
wouldn
t
he
have
some
more
meat
and
had
he
been
given
some
wine
the
old
man
made
no
answer
and
for
a
long
while
could
not
understand
what
he
wa
asked
though
his
neighbour
amused
themselves
by
poking
and
shaking
him
he
simply
gazed
about
him
with
his
mouth
open
which
only
increased
the
general
mirth
what
an
imbecile
look
look
why
wa
he
brought
but
a
to
pyotr
petrovitch
i
always
had
confidence
in
him
katerina
ivanovna
continued
and
of
course
he
is
not
like
with
an
extremely
stern
face
she
addressed
amalia
ivanovna
so
sharply
and
loudly
that
the
latter
wa
quite
disconcerted
not
like
your
dressed
up
draggletails
whom
my
father
would
not
have
taken
a
cook
into
his
kitchen
and
my
late
husband
would
have
done
them
honour
if
he
had
invited
them
in
the
goodness
of
his
yes
he
wa
fond
of
drink
he
wa
fond
of
it
he
did
drink
cried
the
commissariat
clerk
gulping
down
his
twelfth
glass
of
vodka
my
late
husband
certainly
had
that
weakness
and
everyone
know
it
katerina
ivanovna
attacked
him
at
once
but
he
wa
a
kind
and
honourable
man
who
loved
and
respected
his
family
the
worst
of
it
wa
his
good
nature
made
him
trust
all
sort
of
disreputable
people
and
he
drank
with
fellow
who
were
not
worth
the
sole
of
his
shoe
would
you
believe
it
rodion
romanovitch
they
found
a
gingerbread
cock
in
his
pocket
he
wa
dead
drunk
but
he
did
not
forget
the
child
a
cock
did
you
say
a
cock
shouted
the
commissariat
clerk
katerina
ivanovna
did
not
vouchsafe
a
reply
she
sighed
lost
in
thought
no
doubt
you
think
like
everyone
that
i
wa
too
severe
with
him
she
went
on
addressing
raskolnikov
but
that
s
not
so
he
respected
me
he
respected
me
very
much
he
wa
a
man
and
how
sorry
i
wa
for
him
sometimes
he
would
sit
in
a
corner
and
look
at
me
i
used
to
feel
so
sorry
for
him
i
used
to
want
to
be
kind
to
him
and
then
would
think
to
myself
be
kind
to
him
and
he
will
drink
again
it
wa
only
by
severity
that
you
could
keep
him
within
yes
he
used
to
get
his
hair
pulled
pretty
often
roared
the
commissariat
clerk
again
swallowing
another
glass
of
vodka
some
fool
would
be
the
better
for
a
good
drubbing
a
well
a
having
their
hair
pulled
i
am
not
talking
of
my
late
husband
now
katerina
ivanovna
snapped
at
him
the
flush
on
her
cheek
grew
more
and
more
marked
her
chest
heaved
in
another
minute
she
would
have
been
ready
to
make
a
scene
many
of
the
visitor
were
sniggering
evidently
delighted
they
began
poking
the
commissariat
clerk
and
whispering
something
to
him
they
were
evidently
trying
to
egg
him
on
allow
me
to
ask
what
are
you
alluding
to
began
the
clerk
that
is
to
say
whose
about
whom
did
you
say
just
now
but
i
don
t
care
that
s
nonsense
widow
i
forgive
you
pas
and
he
took
another
drink
of
vodka
raskolnikov
sat
in
silence
listening
with
disgust
he
only
ate
from
politeness
just
tasting
the
food
that
katerina
ivanovna
wa
continually
putting
on
his
plate
to
avoid
hurting
her
feeling
he
watched
sonia
intently
but
sonia
became
more
and
more
anxious
and
distressed
she
too
foresaw
that
the
dinner
would
not
end
peaceably
and
saw
with
terror
katerina
ivanovna
s
growing
irritation
she
knew
that
she
sonia
wa
the
chief
reason
for
the
genteel
lady
contemptuous
treatment
of
katerina
ivanovna
s
invitation
she
had
heard
from
amalia
ivanovna
that
the
mother
wa
positively
offended
at
the
invitation
and
had
asked
the
question
how
could
she
let
her
daughter
sit
down
beside
young
sonia
had
a
feeling
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
already
heard
this
and
an
insult
to
sonia
meant
more
to
katerina
ivanovna
than
an
insult
to
herself
her
child
or
her
father
sonia
knew
that
katerina
ivanovna
would
not
be
satisfied
now
till
she
had
shown
those
draggletails
that
they
were
both
to
make
matter
worse
someone
passed
sonia
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
a
plate
with
two
heart
pierced
with
an
arrow
cut
out
of
black
bread
katerina
ivanovna
flushed
crimson
and
at
once
said
aloud
across
the
table
that
the
man
who
sent
it
wa
a
drunken
as
amalia
ivanovna
wa
foreseeing
something
amiss
and
at
the
same
time
deeply
wounded
by
katerina
ivanovna
s
haughtiness
and
to
restore
the
of
the
company
and
raise
herself
in
their
esteem
she
began
apropos
of
nothing
telling
a
story
about
an
acquaintance
of
hers
karl
from
the
chemist
s
who
wa
driving
one
night
in
a
cab
and
that
the
cabman
wanted
him
to
kill
and
karl
very
much
begged
him
not
to
kill
and
wept
and
clasped
hand
and
frightened
and
from
fear
pierced
his
though
katerina
ivanovna
smiled
she
observed
at
once
that
amalia
ivanovna
ought
not
to
tell
anecdote
in
russian
the
latter
wa
still
more
offended
and
she
retorted
that
her
au
wa
a
very
important
man
and
always
went
with
his
hand
in
katerina
ivanovna
could
not
restrain
herself
and
laughed
so
much
that
amalia
ivanovna
lost
patience
and
could
scarcely
control
herself
listen
to
the
owl
katerina
ivanovna
whispered
at
once
her
almost
restored
she
meant
to
say
he
kept
his
hand
in
his
pocket
but
she
said
he
put
his
hand
in
people
s
pocket
and
have
you
noticed
rodion
romanovitch
that
all
these
petersburg
foreigner
the
german
especially
are
all
stupider
than
we
can
you
fancy
anyone
of
u
telling
how
karl
from
the
chemist
s
pierced
his
heart
from
fear
and
that
the
idiot
instead
of
punishing
the
cabman
clasped
his
hand
and
wept
and
much
ah
the
fool
and
you
know
she
fancy
it
s
very
touching
and
doe
not
suspect
how
stupid
she
is
to
my
thinking
that
drunken
commissariat
clerk
is
a
great
deal
cleverer
anyway
one
can
see
that
he
ha
addled
his
brain
with
drink
but
you
know
these
foreigner
are
always
so
well
behaved
and
serious
look
how
she
sits
glaring
she
is
angry
regaining
her
katerina
ivanovna
began
at
once
telling
raskolnikov
that
when
she
had
obtained
her
pension
she
intended
to
open
a
school
for
the
daughter
of
gentleman
in
her
native
town
t
this
wa
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
the
project
and
she
launched
out
into
the
most
alluring
detail
it
suddenly
appeared
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
in
her
hand
the
very
certificate
of
honour
of
which
marmeladov
had
spoken
to
raskolnikov
in
the
tavern
when
he
told
him
that
katerina
ivanovna
his
wife
had
danced
the
shawl
dance
before
the
governor
and
other
great
personage
on
leaving
school
this
certificate
of
honour
wa
obviously
intended
now
to
prove
katerina
ivanovna
s
right
to
open
a
but
she
had
armed
herself
with
it
chiefly
with
the
object
of
overwhelming
those
two
draggletails
if
they
came
to
the
dinner
and
proving
incontestably
that
katerina
ivanovna
wa
of
the
most
noble
she
might
even
say
aristocratic
family
a
colonel
s
daughter
and
wa
far
superior
to
certain
adventuress
who
have
been
so
much
to
the
fore
of
the
certificate
of
honour
immediately
passed
into
the
hand
of
the
drunken
guest
and
katerina
ivanovna
did
not
try
to
retain
it
for
it
actually
contained
the
statement
toutes
that
her
father
wa
of
the
rank
of
a
major
and
also
a
companion
of
an
order
so
that
she
really
wa
almost
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
warming
up
katerina
ivanovna
proceeded
to
enlarge
on
the
peaceful
and
happy
life
they
would
lead
in
t
on
the
gymnasium
teacher
whom
she
would
engage
to
give
lesson
in
her
one
a
most
respectable
old
frenchman
one
mangot
who
had
taught
katerina
ivanovna
herself
in
old
day
and
wa
still
living
in
t
and
would
no
doubt
teach
in
her
school
on
moderate
term
next
she
spoke
of
sonia
who
would
go
with
her
to
t
and
help
her
in
all
her
plan
at
this
someone
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
gave
a
sudden
guffaw
though
katerina
ivanovna
tried
to
appear
to
be
disdainfully
unaware
of
it
she
raised
her
voice
and
began
at
once
speaking
with
conviction
of
sonia
s
undoubted
ability
to
assist
her
of
her
gentleness
patience
devotion
generosity
and
good
education
tapping
sonia
on
the
cheek
and
kissing
her
warmly
twice
sonia
flushed
crimson
and
katerina
ivanovna
suddenly
burst
into
tear
immediately
observing
that
she
wa
nervous
and
silly
that
she
wa
too
much
upset
that
it
wa
time
to
finish
and
a
the
dinner
wa
over
it
wa
time
to
hand
round
the
at
that
moment
amalia
ivanovna
deeply
aggrieved
at
taking
no
part
in
the
conversation
and
not
being
listened
to
made
one
last
effort
and
with
secret
misgiving
ventured
on
an
exceedingly
deep
and
weighty
observation
that
in
the
future
she
would
have
to
pay
particular
attention
to
and
that
there
certainly
must
be
a
good
to
look
after
the
linen
and
secondly
that
the
young
lady
must
not
novel
at
night
katerina
ivanovna
who
certainly
wa
upset
and
very
tired
a
well
a
heartily
sick
of
the
dinner
at
once
cut
short
amalia
ivanovna
saying
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
wa
talking
nonsense
that
it
wa
the
business
of
the
laundry
maid
and
not
of
the
directress
of
a
to
look
after
and
a
for
that
wa
simply
rudeness
and
she
begged
her
to
be
amalia
ivanovna
fired
up
and
getting
angry
observed
that
she
only
meant
her
good
and
that
she
had
meant
her
very
good
and
that
it
wa
long
since
she
had
paid
her
for
the
katerina
ivanovna
at
once
set
her
down
saying
that
it
wa
a
lie
to
say
she
wished
her
good
because
only
yesterday
when
her
dead
husband
wa
lying
on
the
table
she
had
worried
her
about
the
lodging
to
this
amalia
ivanovna
very
appropriately
observed
that
she
had
invited
those
lady
but
those
lady
had
not
come
because
those
lady
lady
and
can
not
come
to
a
lady
who
is
not
a
katerina
ivanovna
at
once
pointed
out
to
her
that
a
she
wa
a
slut
she
could
not
judge
what
made
one
really
a
lady
amalia
ivanovna
at
once
declared
that
her
au
wa
a
very
very
important
man
and
both
hand
in
pocket
went
and
always
used
to
say
poof
poof
and
she
leapt
up
from
the
table
to
represent
her
father
sticking
her
hand
in
her
pocket
puffing
her
cheek
and
uttering
vague
sound
resembling
poof
poof
amid
loud
laughter
from
all
the
lodger
who
purposely
encouraged
amalia
ivanovna
hoping
for
a
fight
but
this
wa
too
much
for
katerina
ivanovna
and
she
at
once
declared
so
that
all
could
hear
that
amalia
ivanovna
probably
never
had
a
father
but
wa
simply
a
drunken
petersburg
finn
and
had
certainly
once
been
a
cook
and
probably
something
worse
amalia
ivanovna
turned
a
red
a
a
lobster
and
squealed
that
perhaps
katerina
ivanovna
never
had
a
father
but
she
had
a
au
and
that
he
wore
a
long
coat
and
always
said
katerina
ivanovna
observed
contemptuously
that
all
knew
what
her
family
wa
and
that
on
that
very
certificate
of
honour
it
wa
stated
in
print
that
her
father
wa
a
colonel
while
amalia
ivanovna
s
father
if
she
really
had
one
wa
probably
some
finnish
milkman
but
that
probably
she
never
had
a
father
at
all
since
it
wa
still
uncertain
whether
her
name
wa
amalia
ivanovna
or
amalia
ludwigovna
at
this
amalia
ivanovna
lashed
to
fury
struck
the
table
with
her
fist
and
shrieked
that
she
wa
amalia
ivanovna
and
not
ludwigovna
that
her
wa
named
johann
and
that
he
wa
a
burgomeister
and
that
katerina
ivanovna
s
wa
quite
never
a
katerina
ivanovna
rose
from
her
chair
and
with
a
stern
and
apparently
calm
voice
though
she
wa
pale
and
her
chest
wa
heaving

that
if
she
dared
for
one
moment
to
set
her
contemptible
wretch
of
a
father
on
a
level
with
her
papa
she
katerina
ivanovna
would
tear
her
cap
off
her
head
and
trample
it
under
amalia
ivanovna
ran
about
the
room
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
that
she
wa
mistress
of
the
house
and
that
katerina
ivanovna
should
leave
the
lodging
that
minute
then
she
rushed
for
some
reason
to
collect
the
silver
spoon
from
the
table
there

a
great
outcry
and
uproar

to
restrain

when
amalia
ivanovna
shouted
something
about
the
yellow
ticket
katerina
ivanovna
pushed
sonia
away
and
rushed
at
the
landlady
to
carry
out
her
threat
at
that
minute
the
door
opened
and
pyotr

luzhin
appeared
on
the
threshold
he
stood
scanning
the
party

severe
and
vigilant
eye

contemptuous
menacing
tone
of

entrance

this
serious
business

strikingly
incongruous
with
the
rest
of
the
party
but
it
wa
evident
too
that
he
had
come
upon
some
matter
of
consequence
that
some
exceptional
cause
must
have
brought
him

minute

appeared
in
the
doorway
he
did
not
come
in

stood
still
listening
with
marked
interest
almost

seemed
for
a
time
perplexed

for
possibly
interrupting
you

it

am
glad
indeed
to
find

humbly
beg
you

have
to

he
went
on
addressing
sonia
who
wa
very
much
surprised
and
already
alarmed
immediately
after
your
visit
i
found
that
a
note
wa
missing
from
my
table
in
the
room
of
my
friend
lebeziatnikov
if
in
any
way
whatever
you
know
and
will
tell
u
where
it
is
now
i
assure
you
on
my
word
of
honour
and
call
all
present
to
witness
that
the
matter
shall
end
there
in
the
opposite
case
i
shall
be
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
very
serious
measure
and
then
you
must
blame
complete
silence
reigned
in
the
room
even
the
cry
child
were
still
sonia
stood
deadly
pale
staring
at
luzhin
and
unable
to
say
a
word
she
seemed
not
to
understand
some
second
passed
well
how
is
it
to
be
then
asked
luzhin
looking
intently
at
her
i
don
t
know
i
know
nothing
about
it
sonia
articulated
faintly
at
last
no
you
know
nothing
luzhin
repeated
and
again
he
paused
for
some
second
think
a
moment
mademoiselle
he
began
severely
but
still
a
it
were
admonishing
her
reflect
i
am
prepared
to
give
you
time
for
consideration
kindly
observe
this
if
i
were
not
so
entirely
convinced
i
should
not
you
may
be
sure
with
my
experience
venture
to
accuse
you
so
directly
seeing
that
for
such
direct
accusation
before
witness
if
false
or
even
mistaken
i
should
myself
in
a
certain
sense
be
made
responsible
i
am
aware
of
that
this
morning
i
changed
for
my
own
purpose
several
security
for
the
sum
of
approximately
three
thousand
rouble
the
account
is
noted
down
in
my
on
my
return
home
i
proceeded
to
count
the
money
a
lebeziatnikov
will
bear
witness
and
after
counting
two
thousand
three
hundred
rouble
i
put
the
rest
in
my
in
my
coat
pocket
about
five
hundred
rouble
remained
on
the
table
and
among
them
three
note
of
a
hundred
rouble
each
at
that
moment
you
entered
at
my
invitation
and
all
the
time
you
were
present
you
were
exceedingly
embarrassed
so
that
three
time
you
jumped
up
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
and
tried
to
make
off
lebeziatnikov
can
bear
witness
to
this
you
yourself
mademoiselle
probably
will
not
refuse
to
confirm
my
statement
that
i
invited
you
through
lebeziatnikov
solely
in
order
to
discus
with
you
the
hopeless
and
destitute
position
of
your
relative
katerina
ivanovna
whose
dinner
i
wa
unable
to
attend
and
the
advisability
of
getting
up
something
of
the
nature
of
a
subscription
lottery
or
the
like
for
her
benefit
you
thanked
me
and
even
shed
tear
i
describe
all
this
a
it
took
place
primarily
to
recall
it
to
your
mind
and
secondly
to
show
you
that
not
the
slightest
detail
ha
escaped
my
recollection
then
i
took
a
note
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
you
by
way
of
first
instalment
on
my
part
for
the
benefit
of
your
relative
lebeziatnikov
saw
all
this
then
i
accompanied
you
to
the
door
you
being
still
in
the
same
state
of
embarrassment
after
which
being
left
alone
with
lebeziatnikov
i
talked
to
him
for
ten
minute
then
lebeziatnikov
went
out
and
i
returned
to
the
table
with
the
money
lying
on
it
intending
to
count
it
and
to
put
it
aside
a
i
proposed
doing
before
to
my
surprise
one
note
had
disappeared
kindly
consider
the
position
lebeziatnikov
i
can
not
suspect
i
am
ashamed
to
allude
to
such
a
supposition
i
can
not
have
made
a
mistake
in
my
reckoning
for
the
minute
before
your
entrance
i
had
finished
my
account
and
found
the
total
correct
you
will
admit
that
recollecting
your
embarrassment
your
eagerness
to
get
away
and
the
fact
that
you
kept
your
hand
for
some
time
on
the
table
and
taking
into
consideration
your
social
position
and
the
habit
associated
with
it
i
wa
so
to
say
with
horror
and
positively
against
my
will
to
entertain
a
suspicion
a
cruel
but
justifiable
suspicion
i
will
add
further
and
repeat
that
in
spite
of
my
positive
conviction
i
realise
that
i
run
a
certain
risk
in
making
this
accusation
but
a
you
see
i
could
not
let
it
pas
i
have
taken
action
and
i
will
tell
you
why
solely
madam
solely
owing
to
your
black
ingratitude
why
i
invite
you
for
the
benefit
of
your
destitute
relative
i
present
you
with
my
donation
of
ten
rouble
and
you
on
the
spot
repay
me
for
all
that
with
such
an
action
it
is
too
bad
you
need
a
lesson
reflect
moreover
like
a
true
friend
i
beg
you
and
you
could
have
no
better
friend
at
this
moment
think
what
you
are
doing
otherwise

shall
be
immovable

about

looking
at

looked
at

stood
against

crossed
looking

some
reason
before

for
thinking

i
beg
you
worthy

in

cried
katerina
ivanovna
suddenly
realising
the
position

she
rushed
at
luzhin
what
you
accuse
her
of
stealing
sonia
ah
the
wretch
the
wretch
and
running
to
sonia
she
flung
her
wasted
arm
round
her

held
her
a
in
a
vise

crumpled
it
up
and
flung
it
straight
into

hit
him
in
the
eye
and
fell
on

from

a
piece
of

flew
out

on

raskolnikov
wa
silent
keeping
his
eye
fixed
on
sonia
except
for
an
occasional
rapid
glance
at
luzhin
sonia
stood
still
a
though
unconscious
she
wa
hardly
able
to
feel
surprise
suddenly
the
colour
rushed
to
her
cheek
she
uttered
a
cry
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hand

cried
with
a

wail
and
she
ran
to
katerina

who
clasped

tightly
in

cried
in
the
face
of
the
obvious
fact
swaying
her
to
and
fro
in
her
arm
like
a
baby
kissing
her
face
continually
then
snatching
at

and
kissing

cried
addressing
the
whole
room

now
at

the
wail
of
the
poor
consumptive
helpless
woman
seemed
to
produce
a
great
effect
on
her
audience
the
agonised
wasted
consumptive
face
the
parched
lip
the
hoarse
voice
the
tear
unrestrained
a
a
child
s
the
trustful
childish
and
yet
despairing
prayer
for
help
were
so
piteous
that
everyone
seemed
to
feel
for
her
pyotr
petrovitch
at
any
rate
wa
at
once
moved
to
madam
madam
this
incident
doe
not
reflect
upon
you
he
cried
impressively
no
one
would
take
upon
himself
to
accuse
you
of
being
an
instigator
or
even
an
accomplice
in
it
especially
a
you
have
proved
her
guilt
by
turning
out
her
pocket
showing
that
you
had
no
previous
idea
of
it
i
am
most
ready
most
ready
to
show
compassion
if
poverty
so
to
speak
drove
sofya
semyonovna
to
it
but
why
did
you
refuse
to
confess
mademoiselle
were
you
afraid
of
the
disgrace
the
first
step
you
lost
your
head
perhaps
one
can
quite
understand
it
but
how
could
you
have
lowered
yourself
to
such
an
action
gentleman
he
addressed
the
whole
company
gentleman
compassionate
and
so
to
say
commiserating
these
people
i
am
ready
to
overlook
it
even
now
in
spite
of
the
personal
insult
lavished
upon
me
and
may
this
disgrace
be
a
lesson
to
you
for
the
future
he
said
addressing
sonia
and
i
will
carry
the
matter
no
further
enough
pyotr
petrovitch
stole
a
glance
at
raskolnikov
their
eye
met
and
the
fire
in
raskolnikov
s
seemed
ready
to
reduce
him
to
ash
meanwhile
katerina
ivanovna
apparently
heard
nothing
she
wa
kissing
and
hugging
sonia
like
a
madwoman
the
child
too
were
embracing
sonia
on
all
side
and
polenka
though
she
did
not
fully
understand
what
wa
wrong
wa
drowned
in
tear
and
shaking
with
sob
a
she
hid
her
pretty
little
face
swollen
with
weeping
on
sonia
s
shoulder
how
vile
a
loud
voice
cried
suddenly
in
the
doorway
pyotr
petrovitch
looked
round
quickly
what
vileness
lebeziatnikov
repeated
staring
him
straight
in
the
face
pyotr
petrovitch
gave
a
positive
start
all
noticed
it
and
recalled
it
afterwards
lebeziatnikov
strode
into
the
room
and
you
dared
to
call
me
a
witness
he
said
going
up
to
pyotr
petrovitch
what
do
you
mean
what
are
you
talking
about
muttered
luzhin
i
mean
that
you
are
a
slanderer
that
s
what
my
word
mean
lebeziatnikov
said
hotly
looking
sternly
at
him
with
his
eye
he
wa
extremely
angry
raskolnikov
gazed
intently
at
him
a
though
seizing
and
weighing
each
word
again
there
wa
a
silence
pyotr
petrovitch
indeed
seemed
almost
dumbfounded
for
the
first
moment
if
you
mean
that
for
me
he
began
stammering
but
what
s
the
matter
with
you
are
you
out
of
your
mind
i
m
in
my
mind
but
you
are
a
scoundrel
ah
how
vile
i
have
heard
everything
i
kept
waiting
on
purpose
to
understand
it
for
i
must
own
even
now
it
is
not
quite
logical
what
you
have
done
it
all
for
i
can
t
why
what
have
i
done
then
give
over
talking
in
your
nonsensical
riddle
or
maybe
you
are
drunk
you
may
be
a
drunkard
perhaps
vile
man
but
i
am
not
i
never
touch
vodka
for
it
s
against
my
conviction
would
you
believe
it
he
he
himself
with
his
own
hand
gave
sofya
semyonovna
that
note
i
saw
it
i
wa
a
witness
i
ll
take
my
oath
he
did
it
he
repeated
lebeziatnikov
addressing
all
are
you
crazy
milksop
squealed
luzhin
she
is
herself
before
you
she
herself
here
declared
just
now
before
everyone
that
i
gave
her
only
ten
rouble
how
could
i
have
given
it
to
her
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
lebeziatnikov
repeated
and
though
it
is
against
my
principle
i
am
ready
this
very
minute
to
take
any
oath
you
like
before
the
court
for
i
saw
how
you
slipped
it
in
her
pocket
only
like
a
fool
i
thought
you
did
it
out
of
kindness
when
you
were
saying
to
her
at
the
door
while
you
held
her
hand
in
one
hand
with
the
other
the
left
you
slipped
the
note
into
her
pocket
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
luzhin
turned
pale
what
lie
he
cried
impudently
why
how
could
you
standing
by
the
window
see
the
note
you
fancied
it
with
your
eye
you
are
raving
no
i
didn
t
fancy
it
and
though
i
wa
standing
some
way
off
i
saw
it
all
and
though
it
certainly
would
be
hard
to
distinguish
a
note
from
the
window
that
s
true
i
knew
for
certain
that
it
wa
a
note
because
when
you
were
going
to
give
sofya
semyonovna
ten
rouble
you
took
up
from
the
table
a
note
i
saw
it
because
i
wa
standing
near
then
and
an
idea
struck
me
at
once
so
that
i
did
not
forget
you
had
it
in
your
hand
you
folded
it
and
kept
it
in
your
hand
all
the
time
i
didn
t
think
of
it
again
until
when
you
were
getting
up
you
changed
it
from
your
right
hand
to
your
left
and
nearly
dropped
it
i
noticed
it
because
the
same
idea
struck
me
again
that
you
meant
to
do
her
a
kindness
without
my
seeing
you
can
fancy
how
i
watched
you
and
i
saw
how
you
succeeded
in
slipping
it
into
her
pocket
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
i
ll
take
my
lebeziatnikov
wa
almost
breathless
exclamation
arose
on
all
hand
chiefly
expressive
of
wonder
but
some
were
menacing
in
tone
they
all
crowded
round
pyotr
petrovitch
katerina
ivanovna
flew
to
lebeziatnikov
i
wa
mistaken
in
you
protect
her
you
are
the
only
one
to
take
her
part
she
is
an
orphan
god
ha
sent
you
katerina
ivanovna
hardly
knowing
what
she
wa
doing
sank
on
her
knee
before
him
a
pack
of
nonsense
yelled
luzhin
roused
to
fury
it
s
all
nonsense
you
ve
been
talking
an
idea
struck
you
you
didn
t
think
you
noticed
what
doe
it
amount
to
so
i
gave
it
to
her
on
the
sly
on
purpose
what
for
with
what
object
what
have
i
to
do
with
this
what
for
that
s
what
i
can
t
understand
but
that
what
i
am
telling
you
is
the
fact
that
s
certain
so
far
from
my
being
mistaken
you
infamous
criminal
man
i
remember
how
on
account
of
it
a
question
occurred
to
me
at
once
just
when
i
wa
thanking
you
and
pressing
your
hand
what
made
you
put
it
secretly
in
her
pocket
why
you
did
it
secretly
i
mean
could
it
be
simply
to
conceal
it
from
me
knowing
that
my
conviction
are
opposed
to
yours
and
that
i
do
not
approve
of
private
benevolence
which
effect
no
radical
cure
well
i
decided
that
you
really
were
ashamed
of
giving
such
a
large
sum
before
me
perhaps
too
i
thought
he
want
to
give
her
a
surprise
when
she
find
a
whole
note
in
her
pocket
for
i
know
some
benevolent
people
are
very
fond
of
decking
out
their
charitable
action
in
that
way
then
the
idea
struck
me
too
that
you
wanted
to
test
her
to
see
whether
when
she
found
it
she
would
come
to
thank
you
then
too
that
you
wanted
to
avoid
thanks
and
that
a
the
saying
is
your
right
hand
should
not
know
something
of
that
sort
in
fact
i
thought
of
so
many
possibility
that
i
put
off
considering
it
but
still
thought
it
indelicate
to
show
you
that
i
knew
your
secret
but
another
idea
struck
me
again
that
sofya
semyonovna
might
easily
lose
the
money
before
she
noticed
it
that
wa
why
i
decided
to
come
in
here
to
call
her
out
of
the
room
and
to
tell
her
that
you
put
a
hundred
rouble
in
her
pocket
but
on
my
way
i
went
first
to
madame
kobilatnikov
s
to
take
them
the
general
treatise
on
the
positive
method
and
especially
to
recommend
piderit
s
article
and
also
wagner
s
then
i
come
on
here
and
what
a
state
of
thing
i
find
now
could
i
could
i
have
all
these
idea
and
reflection
if
i
had
not
seen
you
put
the
note
in
her
pocket
when
lebeziatnikov
finished
his
harangue
with
the
logical
deduction
at
the
end
he
wa
quite
tired
and
the
perspiration
streamed
from
his
face
he
could
not
ala
even
express
himself
correctly
in
russian
though
he
knew
no
other
language
so
that
he
wa
quite
exhausted
almost
emaciated
after
this
heroic
exploit
but
his
speech
produced
a
powerful
effect
he
had
spoken
with
such
vehemence
with
such
conviction
that
everyone
obviously
believed
him
pyotr
petrovitch
felt
that
thing
were
going
badly
with
him
what
is
it
to
do
with
me
if
silly
idea
did
occur
to
you
he
shouted
that
s
no
evidence
you
may
have
dreamt
it
that
s
all
and
i
tell
you
you
are
lying
sir
you
are
lying
and
slandering
from
some
spite
against
me
simply
from
pique
because
i
did
not
agree
with
your
godless
social
proposition
but
this
retort
did
not
benefit
pyotr
petrovitch
murmur
of
disapproval
were
heard
on
all
side
ah
that
s
your
line
now
is
it
cried
lebeziatnikov
that
s
nonsense
call
the
police
and
i
ll
take
my
oath
there
s
only
one
thing
i
can
t
understand
what
made
him
risk
such
a
contemptible
action
oh
pitiful
despicable
man
i
can
explain
why
he
risked
such
an
action
and
if
necessary
i
too
will
swear
to
it
raskolnikov
said
at
last
in
a
firm
voice
and
he
stepped
forward
he
appeared
to
be
firm
and
composed
everyone
felt
clearly
from
the
very
look
of
him
that
he
really
knew
about
it
and
that
the
mystery
would
be
solved
now
i
can
explain
it
all
to
myself
said
raskolnikov
addressing
lebeziatnikov
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
business
i
suspected
that
there
wa
some
scoundrelly
intrigue
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
began
to
suspect
it
from
some
special
circumstance
known
to
me
only
which
i
will
explain
at
once
to
everyone
they
account
for
everything
your
valuable
evidence
ha
finally
made
everything
clear
to
me
i
beg
all
all
to
listen
this
gentleman
he
pointed
to
luzhin
wa
recently
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
my
sister
avdotya
romanovna
raskolnikov
but
coming
to
petersburg
he
quarrelled
with
me
the
day
before
yesterday
at
our
first
meeting
and
i
drove
him
out
of
my
room
i
have
two
witness
to
prove
it
he
is
a
very
spiteful
man
the
day
before
yesterday
i
did
not
know
that
he
wa
staying
here
in
your
room
and
that
consequently
on
the
very
day
we
quarrelled
the
day
before
yesterday
he
saw
me
give
katerina
ivanovna
some
money
for
the
funeral
a
a
friend
of
the
late
marmeladov
he
at
once
wrote
a
note
to
my
mother
and
informed
her
that
i
had
given
away
all
my
money
not
to
katerina
ivanovna
but
to
sofya
semyonovna
and
referred
in
a
most
contemptible
way
to
the
character
of
sofya
semyonovna
that
is
hinted
at
the
character
of
my
attitude
to
sofya
semyonovna
all
this
you
understand
wa
with
the
object
of
dividing
me
from
my
mother
and
sister
by
insinuating
that
i
wa
squandering
on
unworthy
object
the
money
which
they
had
sent
me
and
which
wa
all
they
had
yesterday
evening
before
my
mother
and
sister
and
in
his
presence
i
declared
that
i
had
given
the
money
to
katerina
ivanovna
for
the
funeral
and
not
to
sofya
semyonovna
and
that
i
had
no
acquaintance
with
sofya
semyonovna
and
had
never
seen
her
before
indeed
at
the
same
time
i
added
that
he
pyotr
petrovitch
luzhin
with
all
his
virtue
wa
not
worth
sofya
semyonovna
s
little
finger
though
he
spoke
so
ill
of
her
to
his
question
would
i
let
sofya
semyonovna
sit
down
beside
my
sister
i
answered
that
i
had
already
done
so
that
day
irritated
that
my
mother
and
sister
were
unwilling
to
quarrel
with
me
at
his
insinuation
he
gradually
began
being
unpardonably
rude
to
them
a
final
rupture
took
place
and
he
wa
turned
out
of
the
house
all
this
happened
yesterday
evening
now
i
beg
your
special
attention
consider
if
he
had
now
succeeded
in
proving
that
sofya
semyonovna
wa
a
thief
he
would
have
shown
to
my
mother
and
sister
that
he
wa
almost
right
in
his
suspicion
that
he
had
reason
to
be
angry
at
my
putting
my
sister
on
a
level
with
sofya
semyonovna
that
in
attacking
me
he
wa
protecting
and
preserving
the
honour
of
my
sister
his
betrothed
in
fact
he
might
even
through
all
this
have
been
able
to
estrange
me
from
my
family
and
no
doubt
he
hoped
to
be
restored
to
favour
with
them
to
say
nothing
of
revenging
himself
on
me
personally
for
he
ha
ground
for
supposing
that
the
honour
and
happiness
of
sofya
semyonovna
are
very
precious
to
me
that
wa
what
he
wa
working
for
that
s
how
i
understand
it
that
s
the
whole
reason
for
it
and
there
can
be
no
other
it
wa
like
this
or
somewhat
like
this
that
raskolnikov
wound
up
his
speech
which
wa
followed
very
attentively
though
often
interrupted
by
exclamation
from
his
audience
but
in
spite
of
interruption
he
spoke
clearly
calmly
exactly
firmly
his
decisive
voice
his
tone
of
conviction
and
his
stern
face
made
a
great
impression
on
everyone
yes
yes
that
s
it
lebeziatnikov
assented
gleefully
that
must
be
it
for
he
asked
me
a
soon
a
sofya
semyonovna
came
into
our
room
whether
you
were
here
whether
i
had
seen
you
among
katerina
ivanovna
s
guest
he
called
me
aside
to
the
window
and
asked
me
in
secret
it
wa
essential
for
him
that
you
should
be
here
that
s
it
that
s
it
luzhin
smiled
contemptuously
and
did
not
speak
but
he
wa
very
pale
he
seemed
to
be
deliberating
on
some
mean
of
escape
perhaps
he
would
have
been
glad
to
give
up
everything
and
get
away
but
at
the
moment
this
wa
scarcely
possible
it
would
have
implied
admitting
the
truth
of
the
accusation
brought
against
him
moreover
the
company
which
had
already
been
excited
by
drink
wa
now
too
much
stirred
to
allow
it
the
commissariat
clerk
though
indeed
he
had
not
grasped
the
whole
position
wa
shouting
louder
than
anyone
and
wa
making
some
suggestion
very
unpleasant
to
luzhin
but
not
all
those
present
were
drunk
lodger
came
in
from
all
the
room
the
three
pole
were
tremendously
excited
and
were
continually
shouting
at
him
the
is
a
and
muttering
threat
in
polish
sonia
had
been
listening
with
strained
attention
though
she
too
seemed
unable
to
grasp
it
all
she
seemed
a
though
she
had
just
returned
to
consciousness
she
did
not
take
her
eye
off
raskolnikov
feeling
that
all
her
safety
lay
in
him
katerina
ivanovna
breathed
hard
and
painfully
and
seemed
fearfully
exhausted
amalia
ivanovna
stood
looking
more
stupid
than
anyone
with
her
mouth
wide
open
unable
to
make
out
what
had
happened
she
only
saw
that
pyotr
petrovitch
had
somehow
come
to
grief
raskolnikov
wa
attempting
to
speak
again
but
they
did
not
let
him
everyone
wa
crowding
round
luzhin
with
threat
and
shout
of
abuse
but
pyotr
petrovitch
wa
not
intimidated
seeing
that
his
accusation
of
sonia
had
completely
failed
he
had
recourse
to
insolence
allow
me
gentleman

me

t
squeeze
let
me

he
said
making
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
no
threat
if
you
please
i
assure
you
it
will
be
useless
you
will
gain
nothing

it

to
answer

for

obstructing
the
course

than

our
judge

not
so
blind
and
not
so
drunk
and
will
not
believe
the
testimony
of
two
notorious
infidel
agitator
and
atheist
who
accuse
me
from
motif
of
personal
revenge
which
they
are
foolish
enough
to
admit
yes
allow
me

t
let
me
find
a
trace
of
you
in
my
room
kindly
leave
at
once
and
everything
is
at
an
end
between
u
when
i
think
of
the
trouble
i
ve
been
taking
the
way
i
ve
been
expounding
all
this
fortnight
i
told
you
myself
that
i
wa
going
when
you
tried
to
keep
me
now
i
will
simply
add
that
you
are
a
fool
i
advise
you
to
see
a
doctor
for
your
brain
and
your
short
sight
let
me
pas
gentleman
he
forced
his
way
through
but
the
commissariat
clerk
wa
unwilling
to
let
him
off
so
easily
he
picked
up
a
glass
from
the
table
brandished
it
in
the
air
and
flung
it
at
pyotr
petrovitch
but
the
glass
flew
straight
at
amalia
ivanovna
she
screamed
and
the
clerk
overbalancing
fell
heavily
under
the
table
pyotr
petrovitch
made
his
way
to
his
room
and
half
an
hour
later
had
left
the
house
sonia
timid
by
nature
had
felt
before
that
day
that
she
could
be
more
easily
than
anyone
and
that
she
could
be
wronged
with
impunity
yet
till
that
moment
she
had
fancied
that
she
might
escape
misfortune
by
care
gentleness
and
submissiveness
before
everyone
her
disappointment
wa
too
great
she
could
of
course
bear
with
patience
and
almost
without
murmur
anything
even
this
but
for
the
first
minute
she
felt
it
too
bitter
in
spite
of
her
triumph
and
her
justification
when
her
first
terror
and
stupefaction
had
passed
and
she
could
understand
it
all
clearly
the
feeling
of
her
helplessness
and
of
the
wrong
done
to
her
made
her
heart
throb
with
anguish
and
she
wa
overcome
with
hysterical
weeping
at
last
unable
to
bear
any
more
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
ran
home
almost
immediately
after
luzhin
s
departure
when
amidst
loud
laughter
the
glass
flew
at
amalia
ivanovna
it
wa
more
than
the
landlady
could
endure
with
a
shriek
she
rushed
like
a
fury
at
katerina
ivanovna
considering
her
to
blame
for
everything
out
of
my
lodging
at
once
quick
march
and
with
these
word
she
began
snatching
up
everything
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
that
belonged
to
katerina
ivanovna
and
throwing
it
on
the
floor
katerina
ivanovna
pale
almost
fainting
and
gasping
for
breath
jumped
up
from
the
bed
where
she
had
sunk
in
exhaustion
and
darted
at
amalia
ivanovna
but
the
battle
wa
too
unequal
the
landlady
waved
her
away
like
a
feather
what
a
though
that
godless
calumny
wa
not
enough
this
vile
creature
attack
me
what
on
the
day
of
my
husband
s
funeral
i

turned
out
of
my
lodging
after
eating
my
bread
and
salt

me
into
the
street
with
my
orphan
where
am
i
to
go
wailed
the
poor
woman
sobbing
and
gasping
good
god
she
cried
with
flashing
eye
is

no
justice
upon
earth
whom
should
you
protect
if

street

will
see
whether

is
justice
on

and
throwing
over
her
head
that
green
shawl
which
marmeladov

raskolnikov
katerina
ivanovna
squeezed
her
way
through
the
disorderly
and
drunken
crowd
of
lodger
who
still
filled
the
room
and
wailing
and
tearful
she
ran
into
the
street
with
a
vague
intention
of
going
at
once
somewhere
to
find
justice
polenka
with
the
two
little
one
in
her
arm
crouched
terrified
on
the
trunk
in
the
corner
of
the
room
where
she
waited
trembling
for
her
mother
to
come
back
amalia
ivanovna
raged
about
the
room
shrieking
lamenting
and
throwing
everything
she
came
across
on
the
floor
the
lodger
talked
incoherently
some
commented
to
the
best
of
their
ability
on
what
had
happened
others
quarrelled
and
swore
at
one
another
while
others
struck
up
a
song
now
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
thought
raskolnikov
well
sofya
semyonovna
we
shall
see
what
you
ll
say
now
and
he
set
off
in
the
direction
of
sonia
s
lodging
chapter
iv
raskolnikov
had
been
a
vigorous
and
active
champion
of
sonia
against
luzhin
although
he
had
such
a
load
of
horror
and
anguish
in
his
own
heart
but
having
gone
through
so
much
in
the
morning
he
found
a
sort
of
relief
in
a
change
of
sensation
apart
from
the
strong
personal
feeling
which
impelled
him
to
defend
sonia
he
wa
agitated
too
especially
at
some
moment
by
the
thought
of
his
approaching
interview
with
sonia
he
to
tell
her
who
had
killed
lizaveta
he
knew
the
terrible
suffering
it
would
be
to
him
and
a
it
were
brushed
away
the
thought
of
it
so
when
he
cried
a
he
left
katerina
ivanovna
s
well
sofya
semyonovna
we
shall
see
what
you
ll
say
now
he
wa
still
superficially
excited
still
vigorous
and
defiant
from
his
triumph
over
luzhin
but
strange
to
say
by
the
time
he
reached
sonia
s
lodging
he
felt
a
sudden
impotence
and
fear
he
stood
still
in
hesitation
at
the
door
asking
himself
the
strange
question
must
he
tell
her
who
killed
lizaveta
it
wa
a
strange
question
because
he
felt
at
the
very
time
not
only
that
he
could
not
help
telling
her
but
also
that
he
could
not
put
off
the
telling
he
did
not
yet
know
why
it
must
be
so
he
only
it
and
the
agonising
sense
of
his
impotence
before
the
inevitable
almost
crushed
him
to
cut
short
his
hesitation
and
suffering
he
quickly
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
sonia
from
the
doorway
she
wa
sitting
with
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
her
face
in
her
hand
but
seeing
raskolnikov
she
got
up
at
once
and
came
to
meet
him
a
though
she
were
expecting
him
what
would
have
become
of
me
but
for
you
she
said
quickly
meeting
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
evidently
she
wa
in
haste
to
say
this
to
him
it
wa
what
she
had
been
waiting
for
raskolnikov
went
to
the
table
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
from
which
she
had
only
just
risen
she
stood
facing
him
two
step
away
just
a
she
had
done
the
day
before
well
sonia
he
said
and
felt
that
his
voice
wa
trembling
it
wa
all
due
to
your
social
position
and
the
habit
associated
with
did
you
understand
that
just
now
her
face
showed
her
distress
only
don
t
talk
to
me
a
you
did
yesterday
she
interrupted
him
please
don
t
begin
it
there
is
misery
enough
without
she
made
haste
to
smile
afraid
that
he
might
not
like
the
reproach
i
wa
silly
to
come
away
from
there
what
is
happening
there
now
i
wanted
to
go
back
directly
but
i
kept
thinking
that
you
would
he
told
her
that
amalia
ivanovna
wa
turning
them
out
of
their
lodging
and
that
katerina
ivanovna
had
run
off
somewhere
to
seek
my
god
cried
sonia
let
s
go
at
once
and
she
snatched
up
her
cape
it
s
everlastingly
the
same
thing
said
raskolnikov
irritably
you
ve
no
thought
except
for
them
stay
a
little
with
but
katerina
ivanovna
you
won
t
lose
katerina
ivanovna
you
may
be
sure
she
ll
come
to
you
herself
since
she
ha
run
out
he
added
peevishly
if
she
doesn
t
find
you
here
you
ll
be
blamed
for
it
sonia
sat
down
in
painful
suspense
raskolnikov
wa
silent
gazing
at
the
floor
and
deliberating
this
time
luzhin
did
not
want
to
prosecute
you
he
began
not
looking
at
sonia
but
if
he
had
wanted
to
if
it
had
suited
his
plan
he
would
have
sent
you
to
prison
if
it
had
not
been
for
lebeziatnikov
and
me
ah
yes
she
assented
in
a
faint
voice
yes
she
repeated
preoccupied
and
distressed
but
i
might
easily
not
have
been
there
and
it
wa
quite
an
accident
lebeziatnikov
s
turning
sonia
wa
silent
and
if
you
d
gone
to
prison
what
then
do
you
remember
what
i
said
yesterday
again
she
did
not
answer
he
waited
i
thought
you
would
cry
out
again
don
t
speak
of
it
leave
raskolnikov
gave
a
laugh
but
rather
a
forced
one
what
silence
again
he
asked
a
minute
later
we
must
talk
about
something
you
know
it
would
be
interesting
for
me
to
know
how
you
would
decide
a
certain
problem
a
lebeziatnikov
would
he
wa
beginning
to
lose
the
thread
no
really
i
am
serious
imagine
sonia
that
you
had
known
all
luzhin
s
intention
beforehand
known
that
is
for
a
fact
that
they
would
be
the
ruin
of
katerina
ivanovna
and
the
child
and
yourself
thrown
in
since
you
don
t
count
yourself
for
anything
polenka
too
for
she
ll
go
the
same
way
well
if
suddenly
it
all
depended
on
your
decision
whether
he
or
they
should
go
on
living
that
is
whether
luzhin
should
go
on
living
and
doing
wicked
thing
or
katerina
ivanovna
should
die
how
would
you
decide
which
of
them
wa
to
die
i
ask
you
sonia
looked
uneasily
at
him
there
wa
something
peculiar
in
this
hesitating
question
which
seemed
approaching
something
in
a
roundabout
way
i
felt
that
you
were
going
to
ask
some
question
like
that
she
said
looking
inquisitively
at
him
i
dare
say
you
did
but
how
is
it
to
be
answered
why
do
you
ask
about
what
could
not
happen
said
sonia
reluctantly
then
it
would
be
better
for
luzhin
to
go
on
living
and
doing
wicked
thing
you
haven
t
dared
to
decide
even
that
but
i
can
t
know
the
divine
providence
and
why
do
you
ask
what
can
t
be
answered
what
s
the
use
of
such
foolish
question
how
could
it
happen
that
it
should
depend
on
my
decision
who
ha
made
me
a
judge
to
decide
who
is
to
live
and
who
is
not
to
live
oh
if
the
divine
providence
is
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
there
is
no
doing
anything
raskolnikov
grumbled
morosely
you
d
better
say
straight
out
what
you
want
sonia
cried
in
distress
you
are
leading
up
to
something
again
can
you
have
come
simply
to
torture
me
she
could
not
control
herself
and
began
cry
bitterly
he
looked
at
her
in
gloomy
misery
five
minute
passed
of
course
you
re
right
sonia
he
said
softly
at
last
he
wa
suddenly
changed
his
tone
of
assumed
arrogance
and
helpless
defiance
wa
gone
even
his
voice
wa
suddenly
weak
i
told
you
yesterday
that
i
wa
not
coming
to
ask
forgiveness
and
almost
the
first
thing
i
ve
said
is
to
ask
forgiveness
i
said
that
about
luzhin
and
providence
for
my
own
sake
i
wa
asking
forgiveness
sonia
he
tried
to
smile
but
there
wa
something
helpless
and
incomplete
in
his
pale
smile
he
bowed
his
head
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hand
and
suddenly
a
strange
surprising
sensation
of
a
sort
of
bitter
hatred
for
sonia
passed
through
his
heart
a
it
were
wondering
and
frightened
of
this
sensation
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
intently
at
her
but
he
met
her
uneasy
and
painfully
anxious
eye
fixed
on
him
there
wa
love
in
them
his
hatred
vanished
like
a
phantom
it
wa
not
the
real
feeling
he
had
taken
the
one
feeling
for
the
other
it
only
meant
that
minute
had
come
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hand
again
and
bowed
his
head
suddenly
he
turned
pale
got
up
from
his
chair
looked
at
sonia
and
without
uttering
a
word
sat
down
mechanically
on
her
bed
his
sensation
that
moment
were
terribly
like
the
moment
when
he
had
stood
over
the
old
woman
with
the
axe
in
his
hand
and
felt
that
he
must
not
lose
another
what
s
the
matter
asked
sonia
dreadfully
frightened
he
could
not
utter
a
word
this
wa
not
at
all
not
at
all
the
way
he
had
intended
to
tell
and
he
did
not
understand
what
wa
happening
to
him
now
she
went
up
to
him
softly
sat
down
on
the
bed
beside
him
and
waited
not
taking
her
eye
off
him
her
heart
throbbed
and
sank
it
wa
unendurable
he
turned
his
deadly
pale
face
to
her
his
lip
worked
helplessly
struggling
to
utter
something
a
pang
of
terror
passed
through
sonia
s
heart
what
s
the
matter
she
repeated
drawing
a
little
away
from
him
nothing
sonia
don
t
be
frightened
it
s
nonsense
it
really
is
nonsense
if
you
think
of
it
he
muttered
like
a
man
in
delirium
why
have
i
come
to
torture
you
he
added
suddenly
looking
at
her
why
really
i
keep
asking
myself
that
question
sonia
he
had
perhaps
been
asking
himself
that
question
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
but
now
he
spoke
helplessly
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
and
feeling
a
continual
tremor
all
over
oh
how
you
are
suffering
she
muttered
in
distress
looking
intently
at
him
it
s
all
nonsense
listen
he
suddenly
smiled
a
pale
helpless
smile
for
two
second
you
remember
what
i
meant
to
tell
you
yesterday
sonia
waited
uneasily
i
said
a
i
went
away
that
perhaps
i
wa
saying
for
ever
but
that
if
i
came
i
would
tell
you
who
who
killed
she
began
trembling
all
over
well
here
i
ve
come
to
tell
then
you
really
meant
it
yesterday
she
whispered
with
difficulty
how
do
you
know
she
asked
quickly
a
though
suddenly
regaining
her
reason
sonia
s
face
grew
paler
and
paler
and
she
breathed
painfully
i
she
paused
a
minute
have
they
found
him
she
asked
timidly
then
how
do
you
know
about
she
asked
again
hardly
audibly
and
again
after
a
minute
s
pause
he
turned
to
her
and
looked
very
intently
at
her
guess
he
said
with
the
same
distorted
helpless
smile
a
shudder
passed
over
her
but
you
why
do
you
frighten
me
like
this
she
said
smiling
like
a
child
i
must
be
a
great
friend
of
since
i
know
raskolnikov
went
on
still
gazing
into
her
face
a
though
he
could
not
turn
his
eye
away
he
did
not
mean
to
kill
that
lizaveta
he
killed
her
accidentally
he
meant
to
kill
the
old
woman
when
she
wa
alone
and
he
went
there
and
then
lizaveta
came
in
he
killed
her
another
awful
moment
passed
both
still
gazed
at
one
another
you
can
t
guess
then
he
asked
suddenly
feeling
a
though
he
were
flinging
himself
down
from
a
steeple
whispered
sonia
take
a
good
a
soon
a
he
had
said
this
again
the
same
familiar
sensation
froze
his
heart
he
looked
at
her
and
all
at
once
seemed
to
see
in
her
face
the
face
of
lizaveta
he
remembered
clearly
the
expression
in
lizaveta
s
face
when
he
approached
her
with
the
axe
and
she
stepped
back
to
the
wall
putting
out
her
hand
with
childish
terror
in
her
face
looking
a
little
child
do
when
they
begin
to
be
frightened
of
something
looking
intently
and
uneasily
at
what
frightens
them
shrinking
back
and
holding
out
their
little
hand
on
the
point
of
cry
almost
the
same
thing
happened
now
to
sonia
with
the
same
helplessness
and
the
same
terror
she
looked
at
him
for
a
while
and
suddenly
putting
out
her
left
hand
pressed
her
finger
faintly
against
his
breast
and
slowly
began
to
get
up
from
the
bed
moving
further
from
him
and
keeping
her
eye
fixed
even
more
immovably
on
him
her
terror
infected
him
the
same
fear
showed
itself
on
his
face
in
the
same
way
he
stared
at
her
and
almost
with
the
same
smile
have
you
guessed
he
whispered
at
last
good
god
broke
in
an
awful
wail
from
her
bosom
she
sank
helplessly
on
the
bed
with
her
face
in
the
pillow
but
a
moment
later
she
got
up
moved
quickly
to
him
seized
both
his
hand
and
gripping
them
tight
in
her
thin
finger
began
looking
into
his
face
again
with
the
same
intent
stare
in
this
last
desperate
look
she
tried
to
look
into
him
and
catch
some
last
hope
but
there
wa
no
hope
there
wa
no
doubt
remaining
it
wa
all
true
later
on
indeed
when
she
recalled
that
moment
she
thought
it
strange
and
wondered
why
she
had
seen
at
once
that
there
wa
no
doubt
she
could
not
have
said
for
instance
that
she
had
foreseen
something
of
the
sort
and
yet
now
a
soon
a
he
told
her
she
suddenly
fancied
that
she
had
really
foreseen
this
very
thing
stop
sonia
enough
don
t
torture
me
he
begged
her
miserably
it
wa
not
at
all
not
at
all
like
this
he
had
thought
of
telling
her
but
this
is
how
it
happened
she
jumped
up
seeming
not
to
know
what
she
wa
doing
and
wringing
her
hand
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
but
quickly
went
back
and
sat
down
again
beside
him
her
shoulder
almost
touching
his
all
of
a
sudden
she
started
a
though
she
had
been
stabbed
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
on
her
knee
before
him
she
did
not
know
why
what
have
you
done
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
she
said
in
despair
and
jumping
up
she
flung
herself
on
his
neck
threw
her
arm
round
him
and
held
him
tightly
raskolnikov
drew
back
and
looked
at
her
with
a
mournful
smile
you
are
a
strange
girl
sonia
you
kiss
me
and
hug
me
when
i
tell
you
about
that
you
don
t
think
what
you
are
there
is
no
one
no
one
in
the
whole
world
now
so
unhappy
a
you
she
cried
in
a
frenzy
not
hearing
what
he
said
and
she
suddenly
broke
into
violent
hysterical
weeping
a
feeling
long
unfamiliar
to
him
flooded
his
heart
and
softened
it
at
once
he
did
not
struggle
against
it
two
tear
started
into
his
eye
and
hung
on
his
eyelash
then
you
won
t
leave
me
sonia
he
said
looking
at
her
almost
with
hope
no
no
never
nowhere
cried
sonia
i
will
follow
you
i
will
follow
you
everywhere
oh
my
god
oh
how
miserable
i
am
why
why
didn
t
i
know
you
before
why
didn
t
you
come
before
oh
dear
here
i
have
yes
now
what
s
to
be
done
now
together
together
she
repeated
a
it
were
unconsciously
and
she
hugged
him
again
i
ll
follow
you
to
siberia
he
recoiled
at
this
and
the
same
hostile
almost
haughty
smile
came
to
his
lip
perhaps
i
don
t
want
to
go
to
siberia
yet
sonia
he
said
sonia
looked
at
him
quickly
again
after
her
first
passionate
agonising
sympathy
for
the
unhappy
man
the
terrible
idea
of
the
murder
overwhelmed
her
in
his
changed
tone
she
seemed
to
hear
the
murderer
speaking
she
looked
at
him
bewildered
she
knew
nothing
a
yet
why
how
with
what
object
it
had
been
now
all
these
question
rushed
at
once
into
her
mind
and
again
she
could
not
believe
it
he
he
is
a
murderer
could
it
be
true
what
s
the
meaning
of
it
where
am
i
she
said
in
complete
bewilderment
a
though
still
unable
to
recover
herself
how
could
you
you
a
man
like
you
how
could
you
bring
yourself
to
it
what
doe
it
mean
oh
well
to
plunder
leave
off
sonia
he
answered
wearily
almost
with
vexation
sonia
stood
a
though
struck
dumb
but
suddenly
she
cried
you
were
hungry
it
wa
to
help
your
mother
yes
no
sonia
no
he
muttered
turning
away
and
hanging
his
head
i
wa
not
so
hungry
i
certainly
did
want
to
help
my
mother
but
that
s
not
the
real
thing
either
don
t
torture
me
sonia
clasped
her
hand
could
it
could
it
all
be
true
good
god
what
a
truth
who
could
believe
it
and
how
could
you
give
away
your
last
farthing
and
yet
rob
and
murder
ah
she
cried
suddenly
that
money
you
gave
katerina
ivanovna
that
money
can
that
money
no
sonia
he
broke
in
hurriedly
that
money
wa
not
it
don
t
worry
yourself
that
money
my
mother
sent
me
and
it
came
when
i
wa
ill
the
day
i
gave
it
to
you
razumihin
saw
it
he
received
it
for
me
that
money
wa
mine
my
sonia
listened
to
him
in
bewilderment
and
did
her
utmost
to
comprehend
and
money
i
don
t
even
know
really
whether
there
wa
any
money
he
added
softly
a
though
reflecting
i
took
a
purse
off
her
neck
made
of
chamois
leather
a
purse
stuffed
full
of
something
but
i
didn
t
look
in
it
i
suppose
i
hadn
t
time
and
the
thing
chain
and
trinket
i
buried
under
a
stone
with
the
purse
next
morning
in
a
yard
off
the
v
prospect
they
are
all
there
now
sonia
strained
every
nerve
to
listen
then
why
why
you
said
you
did
it
to
rob
but
you
took
nothing
she
asked
quickly
catching
at
a
straw
i
don
t
know
i
haven
t
yet
decided
whether
to
take
that
money
or
not
he
said
musing
again
and
seeming
to
wake
up
with
a
start
he
gave
a
brief
ironical
smile
ach
what
silly
stuff
i
am
talking
eh
the
thought
flashed
through
sonia
s
mind
wasn
t
he
mad
but
she
dismissed
it
at
once
no
it
wa
something
she
could
make
nothing
of
it
nothing
do
you
know
sonia
he
said
suddenly
with
conviction
let
me
tell
you
if
i
d
simply
killed
because
i
wa
hungry
laying
stress
on
every
word
and
looking
enigmatically
but
sincerely
at
her
i
should
be
now
you
must
believe
that
what
would
it
matter
to
you
he
cried
a
moment
later
with
a
sort
of
despair
what
would
it
matter
to
you
if
i
were
to
confess
that
i
did
wrong
what
do
you
gain
by
such
a
stupid
triumph
over
me
ah
sonia
wa
it
for
that
i
ve
come
to
you
again
sonia
tried
to
say
something
but
did
not
speak
i
asked
you
to
go
with
me
yesterday
because
you
are
all
i
have
go
where
asked
sonia
timidly
not
to
steal
and
not
to
murder
don
t
be
anxious
he
smiled
bitterly
we
are
so
different
and
you
know
sonia
it
s
only
now
only
this
moment
that
i
understand
i
asked
you
to
go
with
me
yesterday
yesterday
when
i
said
it
i
did
not
know
where
i
asked
you
for
one
thing
i
came
to
you
for
one
thing
not
to
leave
me
you
won
t
leave
me
sonia
she
squeezed
his
hand
and
why
why
did
i
tell
her
why
did
i
let
her
know
he
cried
a
minute
later
in
despair
looking
with
infinite
anguish
at
her
here
you
expect
an
explanation
from
me
sonia
you
are
sitting
and
waiting
for
it
i
see
that
but
what
can
i
tell
you
you
won
t
understand
and
will
only
suffer
misery
on
my
account
well
you
are
cry
and
embracing
me
again
why
do
you
do
it
because
i
couldn
t
bear
my
burden
and
have
come
to
throw
it
on
another
you
suffer
too
and
i
shall
feel
better
and
can
you
love
such
a
mean
wretch
but
aren
t
you
suffering
too
cried
sonia
again
a
wave
of
the
same
feeling
surged
into
his
heart
and
again
for
an
instant
softened
it
sonia
i
have
a
bad
heart
take
note
of
that
it
may
explain
a
great
deal
i
have
come
because
i
am
bad
there
are
men
who
wouldn
t
have
come
but
i
am
a
coward
and
a
mean
wretch
but
never
mind
that
s
not
the
point
i
must
speak
now
but
i
don
t
know
how
to
he
paused
and
sank
into
thought
ach
we
are
so
different
he
cried
again
we
are
not
alike
and
why
why
did
i
come
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
no
no
it
wa
a
good
thing
you
came
cried
sonia
it
s
better
i
should
know
far
better
he
looked
at
her
with
anguish
what
if
it
were
really
that
he
said
a
though
reaching
a
conclusion
yes
that
s
what
it
wa
i
wanted
to
become
a
napoleon
that
is
why
i
killed
her
do
you
understand
now
sonia
whispered
naïvely
and
timidly
only
speak
speak
i
shall
understand
i
shall
understand
she
kept
begging
him
you
ll
understand
very
well
we
shall
see
he
paused
and
wa
for
some
time
lost
in
meditation
it
wa
like
this
i
asked
myself
one
day
this
question
what
if
napoleon
for
instance
had
happened
to
be
in
my
place
and
if
he
had
not
had
toulon
nor
egypt
nor
the
passage
of
mont
blanc
to
begin
his
career
with
but
instead
of
all
those
picturesque
and
monumental
thing
there
had
simply
been
some
ridiculous
old
hag
a
pawnbroker
who
had
to
be
murdered
too
to
get
money
from
her
trunk
for
his
career
you
understand
well
would
he
have
brought
himself
to
that
if
there
had
been
no
other
mean
wouldn
t
he
have
felt
a
pang
at
it
being
so
far
from
monumental
and
and
sinful
too
well
i
must
tell
you
that
i
worried
myself
fearfully
over
that
question
so
that
i
wa
awfully
ashamed
when
i
guessed
at
last
all
of
a
sudden
somehow
that
it
would
not
have
given
him
the
least
pang
that
it
would
not
even
have
struck
him
that
it
wa
not
monumental
that
he
would
not
have
seen
that
there
wa
anything
in
it
to
pause
over
and
that
if
he
had
had
no
other
way
he
would
have
strangled
her
in
a
minute
without
thinking
about
it
well
i
too
left
off
thinking
about
it
murdered
her
following
his
example
and
that
s
exactly
how
it
wa
do
you
think
it
funny
yes
sonia
the
funniest
thing
of
all
is
that
perhaps
that
s
just
how
it
sonia
did
not
think
it
at
all
funny
you
had
better
tell
me
straight
out
without
example
she
begged
still
more
timidly
and
scarcely
audibly
he
turned
to
her
looked
sadly
at
her
and
took
her
hand
you
are
right
again
sonia
of
course
that
s
all
nonsense
it
s
almost
all
talk
you
see
you
know
of
course
that
my
mother
ha
scarcely
anything
my
sister
happened
to
have
a
good
education
and
wa
condemned
to
drudge
a
a
governess
all
their
hope
were
centered
on
me
i
wa
a
student
but
i
couldn
t
keep
myself
at
the
university
and
wa
forced
for
a
time
to
leave
it
even
if
i
had
lingered
on
like
that
in
ten
or
twelve
year
i
might
with
luck
hope
to
be
some
sort
of
teacher
or
clerk
with
a
salary
of
a
thousand
rouble
he
repeated
it
a
though
it
were
a
lesson
and
by
that
time
my
mother
would
be
worn
out
with
grief
and
anxiety
and
i
could
not
succeed
in
keeping
her
in
comfort
while
my
sister
well
my
sister
might
well
have
fared
worse
and
it
s
a
hard
thing
to
pas
everything
by
all
one
s
life
to
turn
one
s
back
upon
everything
to
forget
one
s
mother
and
decorously
accept
the
insult
inflicted
on
one
s
sister
why
should
one
when
one
ha
buried
them
to
burden
oneself
with
others
wife
and
child
and
to
leave
them
again
without
a
farthing
so
i
resolved
to
gain
possession
of
the
old
woman
s
money
and
to
use
it
for
my
first
year
without
worrying
my
mother
to
keep
myself
at
the
university
and
for
a
little
while
after
leaving
it
and
to
do
this
all
on
a
broad
thorough
scale
so
a
to
build
up
a
completely
new
career
and
enter
upon
a
new
life
of
independence
well
that
s
all
well
of
course
in
killing
the
old
woman
i
did
wrong
well
that
s
he
struggled
to
the
end
of
his
speech
in
exhaustion
and
let
his
head
sink
oh
that
s
not
it
that
s
not
it
sonia
cried
in
distress
how
could
one
no
that
s
not
right
not
you
see
yourself
that
it
s
not
right
but
i
ve
spoken
truly
it
s
the
a
though
that
could
be
the
truth
good
god
i
ve
only
killed
a
louse
sonia
a
useless
loathsome
harmful
a
human
being
a
louse
i
too
know
it
wasn
t
a
louse
he
answered
looking
strangely
at
her
but
i
am
talking
nonsense
sonia
he
added
i
ve
been
talking
nonsense
a
long
time
that
s
not
it
you
are
right
there
there
were
quite
quite
other
cause
for
it
i
haven
t
talked
to
anyone
for
so
long
sonia
my
head
ache
dreadfully
his
eye
shone
with
feverish
brilliance
he
wa
almost
delirious
an
uneasy
smile
strayed
on
his
lip
his
terrible
exhaustion
could
be
seen
through
his
excitement
sonia
saw
how
he
wa
suffering
she
too
wa
growing
dizzy
and
he
talked
so
strangely
it
seemed
somehow
comprehensible
but
yet
but
how
how
good
god
and
she
wrung
her
hand
in
despair
no
sonia
that
s
not
it
he
began
again
suddenly
raising
his
head
a
though
a
new
and
sudden
train
of
thought
had
struck
and
a
it
were
roused
him
that
s
not
it
better
imagine
yes
it
s
certainly
better
imagine
that
i
am
vain
envious
malicious
base
vindictive
and
well
perhaps
with
a
tendency
to
insanity
let
s
have
it
all
out
at
once
they
ve
talked
of
madness
already
i
noticed
i
told
you
just
now
i
could
not
keep
myself
at
the
university
but
do
you
know
that
perhaps
i
might
have
done
my
mother
would
have
sent
me
what
i
needed
for
the
fee
and
i
could
have
earned
enough
for
clothes
boot
and
food
no
doubt
lesson
had
turned
up
at
half
a
rouble
razumihin
work
but
i
turned
sulky
and
wouldn
t
yes
sulkiness
that
s
the
right
word
for
it
i
sat
in
my
room
like
a
spider
you
ve
been
in
my
den
you
ve
seen
it
and
do
you
know
sonia
that
low
ceiling
and
tiny
room
cramp
the
soul
and
the
mind
ah
how
i
hated
that
garret
and
yet
i
wouldn
t
go
out
of
it
i
wouldn
t
on
purpose
i
didn
t
go
out
for
day
together
and
i
wouldn
t
work
i
wouldn
t
even
eat
i
just
lay
there
doing
nothing
if
nastasya
brought
me
anything
i
ate
it
if
she
didn
t
i
went
all
day
without
i
wouldn
t
ask
on
purpose
from
sulkiness
at
night
i
had
no
light
i
lay
in
the
dark
and
i
wouldn
t
earn
money
for
candle
i
ought
to
have
studied
but
i
sold
my
book
and
the
dust
lie
an
inch
thick
on
the
notebook
on
my
table
i
preferred
lying
still
and
thinking
and
i
kept
thinking
and
i
had
dream
all
the
time
strange
dream
of
all
sort
no
need
to
describe
only
then
i
began
to
fancy
that
no
that
s
not
it
again
i
am
telling
you
wrong
you
see
i
kept
asking
myself
then
why
am
i
so
stupid
that
if
others
are
stupid
and
i
know
they
are
yet
i
won
t
be
wiser
then
i
saw
sonia
that
if
one
wait
for
everyone
to
get
wiser
it
will
take
too
long
afterwards
i
understood
that
that
would
never
come
to
pas
that
men
won
t
change
and
that
nobody
can
alter
it
and
that
it
s
not
worth
wasting
effort
over
it
yes
that
s
so
that
s
the
law
of
their
nature
sonia
that
s
so
and
i
know
now
sonia
that
whoever
is
strong
in
mind
and
spirit
will
have
power
over
them
anyone
who
is
greatly
daring
is
right
in
their
eye
he
who
despises
most
thing
will
be
a
lawgiver
among
them
and
he
who
dare
most
of
all
will
be
most
in
the
right
so
it
ha
been
till
now
and
so
it
will
always
be
a
man
must
be
blind
not
to
see
it
though
raskolnikov
looked
at
sonia
a
he
said
this
he
no
longer
cared
whether
she
understood
or
not
the
fever
had
complete
hold
of
him
he
wa
in
a
sort
of
gloomy
ecstasy
he
certainly
had
been
too
long
without
talking
to
anyone
sonia
felt
that
his
gloomy
creed
had
become
his
faith
and
code
i
divined
then
sonia
he
went
on
eagerly
that
power
is
only
vouchsafed
to
the
man
who
dare
to
stoop
and
pick
it
up
there
is
only
one
thing
one
thing
needful
one
ha
only
to
dare
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
an
idea
took
shape
in
my
mind
which
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
before
me
no
one
i
saw
clear
a
daylight
how
strange
it
is
that
not
a
single
person
living
in
this
mad
world
ha
had
the
daring
to
go
straight
for
it
all
and
send
it
flying
to
the
devil
i
i
wanted
have
the
and
i
killed
her
i
only
wanted
to
have
the
daring
sonia
that
wa
the
whole
cause
of
it
oh
hush
hush
cried
sonia
clasping
her
hand
you
turned
away
from
god
and
god
ha
smitten
you
ha
given
you
over
to
the
devil
then
sonia
when
i
used
to
lie
there
in
the
dark
and
all
this
became
clear
to
me
wa
it
a
temptation
of
the
devil
eh
hush
don
t
laugh
blasphemer
you
don
t
understand
you
don
t
understand
oh
god
he
won
t
understand
hush
sonia
i
am
not
laughing
i
know
myself
that
it
wa
the
devil
leading
me
hush
sonia
hush
he
repeated
with
gloomy
insistence
i
know
it
all
i
have
thought
it
all
over
and
over
and
whispered
it
all
over
to
myself
lying
there
in
the
dark
i
ve
argued
it
all
over
with
myself
every
point
of
it
and
i
know
it
all
all
and
how
sick
how
sick
i
wa
then
of
going
over
it
all
i
have
kept
wanting
to
forget
it
and
make
a
new
beginning
sonia
and
leave
off
thinking
and
you
don
t
suppose
that
i
went
into
it
headlong
like
a
fool
i
went
into
it
like
a
wise
man
and
that
wa
just
my
destruction
and
you
mustn
t
suppose
that
i
didn
t
know
for
instance
that
if
i
began
to
question
myself
whether
i
had
the
right
to
gain
power
i
certainly
hadn
t
the
right
or
that
if
i
asked
myself
whether
a
human
being
is
a
louse
it
proved
that
it
wasn
t
so
for
me
though
it
might
be
for
a
man
who
would
go
straight
to
his
goal
without
asking
question
if
i
worried
myself
all
those
day
wondering
whether
napoleon
would
have
done
it
or
not
i
felt
clearly
of
course
that
i
wasn
t
napoleon
i
had
to
endure
all
the
agony
of
that
battle
of
idea
sonia
and
i
longed
to
throw
it
off
i
wanted
to
murder
without
casuistry
to
murder
for
my
own
sake
for
myself
alone
i
didn
t
want
to
lie
about
it
even
to
myself
it
wasn
t
to
help
my
mother
i
did
the
murder
that
s
nonsense
i
didn
t
do
the
murder
to
gain
wealth
and
power
and
to
become
a
benefactor
of
mankind
nonsense
i
simply
did
it
i
did
the
murder
for
myself
for
myself
alone
and
whether
i
became
a
benefactor
to
others
or
spent
my
life
like
a
spider
catching
men
in
my
web
and
sucking
the
life
out
of
men
i
couldn
t
have
cared
at
that
moment
and
it
wa
not
the
money
i
wanted
sonia
when
i
did
it
it
wa
not
so
much
the
money
i
wanted
but
something
else
i
know
it
all
now
understand
me
perhaps
i
should
never
have
committed
a
murder
again
i
wanted
to
find
out
something
else
it
wa
something
else
led
me
on
i
wanted
to
find
out
then
and
quickly
whether
i
wa
a
louse
like
everybody
else
or
a
man
whether
i
can
step
over
barrier
or
not
whether
i
dare
stoop
to
pick
up
or
not
whether
i
am
a
trembling
creature
or
whether
i
have
the
to
kill
have
the
right
to
kill
sonia
clasped
her
hand
ach
sonia
he
cried
irritably
and
seemed
about
to
make
some
retort
but
wa
contemptuously
silent
don
t
interrupt
me
sonia
i
want
to
prove
one
thing
only
that
the
devil
led
me
on
then
and
he
ha
shown
me
since
that
i
had
not
the
right
to
take
that
path
because
i
am
just
such
a
louse
a
all
the
rest
he
wa
mocking
me
and
here
i
ve
come
to
you
now
welcome
your
guest
if
i
were
not
a
louse
should
i
have
come
to
you
listen
when
i
went
then
to
the
old
woman
s
i
only
went
to
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
you
murdered
her
but
how
did
i
murder
her
is
that
how
men
do
murder
do
men
go
to
commit
a
murder
a
i
went
then
i
will
tell
you
some
day
how
i
went
did
i
murder
the
old
woman
i
murdered
myself
not
her
i
crushed
myself
once
for
all
for
ever
but
it
wa
the
devil
that
killed
that
old
woman
not
i
enough
enough
sonia
enough
let
me
be
he
cried
in
a
sudden
spasm
of
agony
let
me
be
he
leaned
his
elbow
on
his
knee
and
squeezed
his
head
in
his
hand
a
in
a
vise
what
suffering
a
wail
of
anguish
broke
from
sonia
well
what
am
i
to
do
now
he
asked
suddenly
raising
his
head
and
looking
at
her
with
a
face
hideously
distorted
by
despair
what
are
you
to
do
she
cried
jumping
up
and
her
eye
that
had
been
full
of
tear
suddenly
began
to
shine
stand
up
she
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
he
got
up
looking
at
her
almost
bewildered
go
at
once
this
very
minute
stand
at
the
bow
down
first
kiss
the
earth
which
you
have
defiled
and
then
bow
down
to
all
the
world
and
say
to
all
men
aloud
i
am
a
murderer
then
god
will
send
you
life
again
will
you
go

she
asked
him
trembling
all
over
snatching
his
two
hand
squeezing
them
tight
in
hers
and
gazing
at
him
with
eye
full
of
fire
he
wa
amazed
at
her
sudden
ecstasy
you
mean
siberia
sonia
i
must
give
myself
up
he
asked
gloomily
suffer
and
expiate
your
sin
by
it
that
s
what
you
must

he
said
softly
what

done
them
why
should
i
go
to
them
what
should

and
scoundrel
sonia
i
am
not
going
to
them
and
what
should
i
say
to
them
that
i
murdered
her
but
did
not
dare
to
take
the
money
and
hid
it
under
a
stone
he
added
with
a
bitter
smile
why
they
would
laugh
at
me
and
would
call
me
a
fool
for
not
getting
it
a
coward
and
a
fool
they
wouldn
t
understand
and
they
don
t
deserve
to
understand
why
should
i
go
to
them
i
won
t
don
t
be
a
child
sonia
it
will
be
too
much
for
you
to
bear
too
much
she
repeated
holding
out
her
hand
in
despairing
supplication
perhaps
i
ve
been
unfair
to
myself
he
observed
gloomily
pondering
perhaps
after
all
i
am
a
man
and
not
a
louse
and
i
ve
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
condemn
myself
i
ll
make
another
fight
for
a
haughty
smile
appeared
on
his
lip
what
a
burden
to
bear
and
your
whole
life
your
whole
life
i
shall
get
used
to
it
he
said
grimly
and
thoughtfully
listen
he
began
a
minute
later
stop
cry
it
s
time
to
talk
of
the
fact
i
ve
come
to
tell
you
that
the
police
are
after
me
on
my
track
ach
sonia
cried
in
terror
well
why
do
you
cry
out
you
want
me
to
go
to
siberia
and
now
you
are
frightened
but
let
me
tell
you
i
shall
not
give
myself
up
i
shall
make
a
struggle
for
it
and
they
won
t
do
anything
to
me
they
ve
no
real
evidence
yesterday
i
wa
in
great
danger
and
believed
i
wa
lost
but
thing
are
going
better
all
the
fact
they
know
can
be
explained
two
way
that
s
to
say
i
can
turn
their
accusation
to
my
credit
do
you
understand
and
i
shall
for
i
ve
learnt
my
lesson
but
they
will
certainly
arrest
me
if
it
had
not
been
for
something
that
happened
they
would
have
done
so
for
certain
perhaps
even
now
they
will
arrest
me
but
that
s
no
matter
sonia
they
ll
let
me
out
again
for
there
isn
t
any
real
proof
against
me
and
there
won
t
be
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
and
they
can
t
convict
a
man
on
what
they
have
against
me
enough
i
only
tell
you
that
you
may
know
i
will
try
to
manage
somehow
to
put
it
to
my
mother
and
sister
so
that
they
won
t
be
frightened
my
sister
s
future
is
secure
however
now
i
believe
and
my
mother
s
must
be
too
well
that
s
all
be
careful
though
will
you
come
and
see
me
in
prison
when
i
am
there
oh
i
will
i
they
sat
side
by
side
both
mournful
and
dejected
a
though
they
had
been
cast
up
by
the
tempest
alone
on
some
deserted
shore
he
looked
at
sonia
and
felt
how
great
wa
her
love
for
him
and
strange
to
say
he
felt
it
suddenly
burdensome
and
painful
to
be
so
loved
yes
it
wa
a
strange
and
awful
sensation
on
his
way
to
see
sonia
he
had
felt
that
all
his
hope
rested
on
her
he
expected
to
be
rid
of
at
least
part
of
his
suffering
and
now
when
all
her
heart
turned
towards
him
he
suddenly
felt
that
he
wa
immeasurably
unhappier
than
before
sonia
he
said
you
d
better
not
come
and
see
me
when
i
am
in
sonia
did
not
answer
she
wa
cry
several
minute
passed
have
you
a
cross
on
you
she
asked
a
though
suddenly
thinking
of
it
he
did
not
at
first
understand
the
question
no
of
course
not
here
take
this
one
of
cypress
wood
i
have
another
a
copper
one
that
belonged
to
lizaveta
i
changed
with
lizaveta
she
gave
me
her
cross
and
i
gave
her
my
little
ikon
i
will
wear
lizaveta
s
now
and
give
you
this
take
it
it
s
mine
it
s
mine
you
know
she
begged
him
we
will
go
to
suffer
together
and
together
we
will
bear
our
cross
give
it
me
said
raskolnikov
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
feeling
but
immediately
he
drew
back
the
hand
he
held
out
for
the
cross
not
now
sonia
better
later
he
added
to
comfort
her
yes
yes
better
she
repeated
with
conviction
when
you
go
to
meet
your
suffering
then
put
it
on
you
will
come
to
me
i
ll
put
it
on
you
we
will
pray
and
go
at
that
moment
someone
knocked
three
time
at
the
door
sofya
semyonovna
may
i
come
in
they
heard
in
a
very
familiar
and
polite
voice
sonia
rushed
to
the
door
in
a
fright
the
flaxen
head
of
lebeziatnikov
appeared
at
the
door
chapter
v
lebeziatnikov
looked
perturbed
i
ve
come
to
you
sofya
semyonovna
he
began
excuse
me
i
thought
i
should
find
you
he
said
addressing
raskolnikov
suddenly
that
is
i
didn
t
mean
anything
of
that
sort
but
i
just
thought
katerina
ivanovna
ha
gone
out
of
her
mind
he
blurted
out
suddenly
turning
from
raskolnikov
to
sonia
sonia
screamed
at
least
it
seems
so
but
we
don
t
know
what
to
do
you
see
she
came
back
she
seems
to
have
been
turned
out
somewhere
perhaps
beaten
so
it
seems
at
least
she
had
run
to
your
father
s
former
chief
she
didn
t
find
him
at
home
he
wa
dining
at
some
other
general
s
only
fancy
she
rushed
off
there
to
the
other
general
s
and
imagine
she
wa
so
persistent
that
she
managed
to
get
the
chief
to
see
her
had
him
fetched
out
from
dinner
it
seems
you
can
imagine
what
happened
she
wa
turned
out
of
course
but
according
to
her
own
story
she
abused
him
and
threw
something
at
him
one
may
well
believe
it
how
it
is
she
wasn
t
taken
up
i
can
t
understand
now
she
is
telling
everyone
including
amalia
ivanovna
but
it
s
difficult
to
understand
her
she
is
screaming
and
flinging
herself
about
oh
yes
she
shout
that
since
everyone
ha
abandoned
her
she
will
take
the
child
and
go
into
the
street
with
a
and
the
child
will
sing
and
dance
and
she
too
and
collect
money
and
will
go
every
day
under
the
general
s
window
to
let
everyone
see
child
whose
father
wa
an
official
begging
in
the
she
keep
beating
the
child
and
they
are
all
cry
she
is
teaching
lida
to
sing
my
village
the
boy
to
dance
polenka
the
same
she
is
tearing
up
all
the
clothes
and
making
them
little
cap
like
actor
she
mean
to
carry
a
tin
basin
and
make
it
tinkle
instead
of
music
she
won
t
listen
to
anything
imagine
the
state
of
thing
it
s
beyond
anything
lebeziatnikov
would
have
gone
on
but
sonia
who
had
heard
him
almost
breathless
snatched
up
her
cloak
and
hat
and
ran
out
of
the
room
putting
on
her
thing
a
she
went
raskolnikov
followed
her
and
lebeziatnikov
came
after
him
she
ha
certainly
gone
mad
he
said
to
raskolnikov
a
they
went
out
into
the
street
i
didn
t
want
to
frighten
sofya
semyonovna
so
i
said
it
seemed
like
it
but
there
isn
t
a
doubt
of
it
they
say
that
in
consumption
the
tubercle
sometimes
occur
in
the
brain
it
s
a
pity
i
know
nothing
of
medicine
i
did
try
to
persuade
her
but
she
wouldn
t
did
you
talk
to
her
about
the
tubercle
not
precisely
of
the
tubercle
besides
she
wouldn
t
have
understood
but
what
i
say
is
that
if
you
convince
a
person
logically
that
he
ha
nothing
to
cry
about
he
ll
stop
cry
that
s
clear
is
it
your
conviction
that
he
won
t
life
would
be
too
easy
if
it
were
so
answered
raskolnikov
excuse
me
excuse
me
of
course
it
would
be
rather
difficult
for
katerina
ivanovna
to
understand
but
do
you
know
that
in
paris
they
have
been
conducting
serious
experiment
a
to
the
possibility
of
curing
the
insane
simply
by
logical
argument
one
professor
there
a
scientific
man
of
standing
lately
dead
believed
in
the
possibility
of
such
treatment
his
idea
wa
that
there
s
nothing
really
wrong
with
the
physical
organism
of
the
insane
and
that
insanity
is
so
to
say
a
logical
mistake
an
error
of
judgment
an
incorrect
view
of
thing
he
gradually
showed
the
madman
his
error
and
would
you
believe
it
they
say
he
wa
successful
but
a
he
made
use
of
douche
too
how
far
success
wa
due
to
that
treatment
remains
uncertain
so
it
seems
at
raskolnikov
had
long
ceased
to
listen
reaching
the
house
where
he
lived
he
nodded
to
lebeziatnikov
and
went
in
at
the
gate
lebeziatnikov
woke
up
with
a
start
looked
about
him
and
hurried
on
raskolnikov
went
into
his
little
room
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
it
why
had
he
come
back
here
he
looked
at
the
yellow
and
tattered
paper
at
the
dust
at
his
sofa
from
the
yard
came
a
loud
continuous
knocking
someone
seemed
to
be
hammering
he
went
to
the
window
rose
on
tiptoe
and
looked
out
into
the
yard
for
a
long
time
with
an
air
of
absorbed
attention
but
the
yard
wa
empty
and
he
could
not
see
who
wa
hammering
in
the
house
on
the
left
he
saw
some
open
window
on
the
were
pot
of
geranium
linen
wa
hung
out
of
the
window
he
knew
it
all
by
heart
he
turned
away
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
never
never
had
he
felt
himself
so
fearfully
alone
yes
he
felt
once
more
that
he
would
perhaps
come
to
hate
sonia
now
that
he
had
made
her
more
miserable
why
had
he
gone
to
her
to
beg
for
her
tear
what
need
had
he
to
poison
her
life
oh
the
meanness
of
it
i
will
remain
alone
he
said
resolutely
and
she
shall
not
come
to
the
prison
five
minute
later
he
raised
his
head
with
a
strange
smile
that
wa
a
strange
thought
perhaps
it
really
would
be
better
in
siberia
he
thought
suddenly
he
could
not
have
said
how
long
he
sat
there
with
vague
thought
surging
through
his
mind
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
dounia
came
in
at
first
she
stood
still
and
looked
at
him
from
the
doorway
just
a
he
had
done
at
sonia
then
she
came
in
and
sat
down
in
the
same
place
a
yesterday
on
the
chair
facing
him
he
looked
silently
and
almost
vacantly
at
her
don
t
be
angry
brother
i
ve
only
come
for
one
minute
said
dounia
her
face
looked
thoughtful
but
not
stern
her
eye
were
bright
and
soft
he
saw
that
she
too
had
come
to
him
with
love
brother
now
i
know
all
dmitri
prokofitch
ha
explained
and
told
me
everything
they
are
worrying
and
persecuting
you
through
a
stupid
and
contemptible
suspicion
dmitri
prokofitch
told
me
that
there
is
no
danger
and
that
you
are
wrong
in
looking
upon
it
with
such
horror
i
don
t
think
so
and
i
fully
understand
how
indignant
you
must
be
and
that
that
indignation
may
have
a
permanent
effect
on
you
that
s
what
i
am
afraid
of
a
for
your
cutting
yourself
off
from
u
i
don
t
judge
you
i
don
t
venture
to
judge
you
and
forgive
me
for
having
blamed
you
for
it
i
feel
that
i
too
if
i
had
so
great
a
trouble
should
keep
away
from
everyone
i
shall
tell
mother
nothing
but
i
shall
talk
about
you
continually
and
shall
tell
her
from
you
that
you
will
come
very
soon
don
t
worry
about
her
will
set
her
mind
at
rest
but
don
t
you
try
her
too
much
come
once
at
least
remember
that
she
is
your
mother
and
now
i
have
come
simply
to
say
dounia
began
to
get
up
that
if
you
should
need
me
or
should
need
all
my
life
or
anything
call
me
and
i
ll
come
she
turned
abruptly
and
went
towards
the
door
dounia
raskolnikov
stopped
her
and
went
towards
her
that
razumihin
dmitri
prokofitch
is
a
very
good
dounia
flushed
slightly
well
she
asked
waiting
a
moment
he
is
competent
hardworking
honest
and
capable
of
real
love
dounia
flushed
crimson
then
suddenly
she
took
alarm
but
what
doe
it
mean
brother
are
we
really
parting
for
ever
that
you
give
me
such
a
parting
message
never
mind
he
turned
away
and
walked
to
the
window
she
stood
a
moment
looked
at
him
uneasily
and
went
out
troubled
no
he
wa
not
cold
to
her
there
wa
an
instant
the
very
last
one
when
he
had
longed
to
take
her
in
his
arm
and
to
her
and
even
her
but
he
had
not
dared
even
to
touch
her
hand
afterwards
she
may
shudder
when
she
remembers
that
i
embraced
her
and
will
feel
that
i
stole
her
and
would
stand
that
test
he
went
on
a
few
minute
later
to
himself
no
she
wouldn
t
girl
like
that
can
t
stand
thing
they
never
and
he
thought
of
sonia
there
wa
a
breath
of
fresh
air
from
the
window
the
daylight
wa
fading
he
took
up
his
cap
and
went
out
he
could
not
of
course
and
would
not
consider
how
ill
he
wa
but
all
this
continual
anxiety
and
agony
of
mind
could
not
but
affect
him
and
if
he
were
not
lying
in
high
fever
it
wa
perhaps
just
because
this
continual
inner
strain
helped
to
keep
him
on
his
leg
and
in
possession
of
his
faculty
but
this
artificial
excitement
could
not
last
long
he
wandered
aimlessly
the
sun
wa
setting
a
special
form
of
misery
had
begun
to
oppress
him
of
late
there
wa
nothing
poignant
nothing
acute
about
it
but
there
wa
a
feeling
of
permanence
of
eternity
about
it
it
brought
a
foretaste
of
hopeless
year
of
this
cold
leaden
misery
a
foretaste
of
an
eternity
on
a
square
yard
of
towards
evening
this
sensation
usually
began
to
weigh
on
him
more
heavily
with
this
idiotic
purely
physical
weakness
depending
on
the
sunset
or
something
one
can
t
help
doing
something
stupid
you
ll
go
to
dounia
a
well

he
muttered
bitterly
he
heard
his
name
called
he
looked
round
lebeziatnikov
rushed
up
to
him
only
fancy
i
ve
been
to
your
room
looking
for
you
only

carried
out
her
plan
and
taken
away
the
child
sofya
semyonovna
and
i
have
had
a
job
to
find
them
she
is
rapping
on
a
and
making
the
child
dance
the
child
are
cry
they
keep
stopping
at
the
and
in
front
of
shop
there
s
a
crowd
of
fool
running
after
them
come
along
and
sonia
raskolnikov
asked
anxiously
hurrying
after
lebeziatnikov
simply
frantic
that
is
it
s
not
sofya
semyonovna
s
frantic
but
katerina
ivanovna
though
sofya
semyonova
s
frantic
too
but
katerina
ivanovna
is
absolutely
frantic
i
tell
you
she
is
quite
mad
they
ll
be
taken
to
the
police
you
can
fancy
what
an
effect
that
will
have
they
are
on
the
canal
bank
near
the
bridge
now
not
far
from
sofya
semyonovna
s
quite
on
the
canal
bank
near
the
bridge
and
not
two
house
away
from
the
one
where
sonia
lodged
there
wa
a
crowd
of
people
consisting
principally
of
gutter
child
the
hoarse
broken
voice
of
katerina
ivanovna
could
be
heard
from
the
bridge
and
it
certainly
wa
a
strange
spectacle
likely
to
attract
a
street
crowd
katerina
ivanovna
in
her
old
dress
with
the
green
shawl
wearing
a
torn
straw
hat
crushed
in
a
hideous
way
on
one
side
wa
really
frantic
she
wa
exhausted
and
breathless
her
wasted
consumptive
face
looked
more
suffering
than
ever
and
indeed
out
of
door
in
the
sunshine
a
consumptive
always
look
worse
than
at
home
but
her
excitement
did
not
flag
and
every
moment
her
irritation
grew
more
intense
she
rushed
at
the
child
shouted
at
them
coaxed
them
told
them
before
the
crowd
how
to
dance
and
what
to
sing
began
explaining
to
them
why
it
wa
necessary
and
driven
to
desperation
by
their
not
understanding
beat
them
then
she
would
make
a
rush
at
the
crowd
if
she
noticed
any
decently
dressed
person
stopping
to
look
she
immediately
appealed
to
him
to
see
what
these
child
from
a
genteel
one
may
say
aristocratic
house
had
been
brought
to
if
she
heard
laughter
or
jeering
in
the
crowd
she
would
rush
at
once
at
the
scoffer
and
begin
squabbling
with
them
some
people
laughed
others
shook
their
head
but
everyone
felt
curious
at
the
sight
of
the
madwoman
with
the
frightened
child
the
of
which
lebeziatnikov
had
spoken
wa
not
there
at
least
raskolnikov
did
not
see
it
but
instead
of
rapping
on
the
pan
katerina
ivanovna
began
clapping
her
wasted
hand
when
she
made
lida
and
kolya
dance
and
polenka
sing
she
too
joined
in
the
singing
but
broke
down
at
the
second
note
with
a
fearful
cough
which
made
her
curse
in
despair
and
even
shed
tear
what
made
her
most
furious
wa
the
weeping
and
terror
of
kolya
and
lida
some
effort
had
been
made
to
dress
the
child
up
a
street
singer
are
dressed
the
boy
had
on
a
turban
made
of
something
red
and
white
to
look
like
a
turk
there
had
been
no
costume
for
lida
she
simply
had
a
red
knitted
cap
or
rather
a
night
cap
that
had
belonged
to
marmeladov
decorated
with
a
broken
piece
of
white
ostrich
feather
which
had
been
katerina
ivanovna
s
grandmother
s
and
had
been
preserved
a
a
family
possession
polenka
wa
in
her
everyday
dress
she
looked
in
timid
perplexity
at
her
mother
and
kept
at
her
side
hiding
her
tear
she
dimly
realised
her
mother
s
condition
and
looked
uneasily
about
her
she
wa
terribly
frightened
of
the
street
and
the
crowd
sonia
followed
katerina
ivanovna
weeping
and
beseeching
her
to
return
home

katerina
ivanovna

not
to
be
persuaded

to
the

to
persuade

to
go

and
even
said
hoping
to
work
on
her
vanity
that

unseemly
for

to
be
wandering
about

a

intending
to

and
tried
to
sit
up
at

in
a
horribly
hoarse
broken
voice
she
began
shrieking
and
gasping
at
every
word
with
a
look
of
growing
terror
in
the
heat
of
midday
in
the
vale
of
dagestan
with
lead
in
my
breast
your

started

consciousness
and
gazed
at
all
with
a
sort
of
terror
but
at
once
recognised
sonia

and
caressingly

she
cried
with
vindictive
despair
and
her
head
fell
heavily
back
on
the
pillow
she
sank
into
unconsciousness
again
but
this
time
it
did
not
last
long
her
pale
yellow
wasted
face
dropped
back

gave
a
deep
deep
sigh
and

upon

her
arm
about

wasted
bosom
polenka
threw
herself
at
her
mother

foot
kissing
them
and
weeping
violently
though
kolya
and
lida
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
they
had
a
feeling
that
it
wa
something
terrible
they
put
their
hand
on
each
other
s
little
shoulder
stared
straight
at
one
another
and
both
at
once
opened
their
mouth
and
began
screaming
they
were
both
still
in
their
fancy
dress
one
in
a
turban
the
other
in
the
cap
with
the
ostrich

away

svidrigaïlov
i
told
you
i
had
no
need
of
that
money

t
you
admit
that
it
s
simply
done
from
humanity
she
wasn
t
a
louse
you
know
he
pointed
to
the
corner
where
the
dead
woman
lay
wa
she
like
some
old
pawnbroker
woman
come

to
die
and
if
i
didn
t
help
them
polenka

go
the
same
he
said
this
with
an
air
of
a
sort
of
gay
winking
slyness
keeping
his
eye
fixed
on
raskolnikov
who
turned
white
and
cold
hearing
his
own
phrase
spoken
to
sonia
he
quickly
stepped
back
and
looked
wildly
at
svidrigaïlov
how
do
you
know
he
whispered
hardly
able
to
breathe
why

lodge
here

other
side
of

and
devoted
friend

svidrigaïlov
shaking
with
laughter

my
honour

see
that
you
can
get
on
with
me
part
vi
chapter
i
a
strange
period
began
for
raskolnikov
it
wa
a
though
a
fog
had
fallen
upon
him
and
wrapped
him
in
a
dreary
solitude
from
which
there
wa
no
escape
recalling
that
period
long
after
he
believed
that
his
mind
had
been
clouded
at
time
and
that
it
had
continued
so
with
interval
till
the
final
catastrophe
he
wa
convinced
that
he
had
been
mistaken
about
many
thing
at
that
time
for
instance
a
to
the
date
of
certain
event
anyway
when
he
tried
later
on
to
piece
his
recollection
together
he
learnt
a
great
deal
about
himself
from
what
other
people
told
him
he
had
mixed
up
incident
and
had
explained
event
a
due
to
circumstance
which
existed
only
in
his
imagination
at
time
he
wa
a
prey
to
agony
of
morbid
uneasiness
amounting
sometimes
to
panic
but
he
remembered
too
moment
hour
perhaps
whole
day
of
complete
apathy
which
came
upon
him
a
a
reaction
from
his
previous
terror
and
might
be
compared
with
the
abnormal
insensibility
sometimes
seen
in
the
dying
he
seemed
to
be
trying
in
that
latter
stage
to
escape
from
a
full
and
clear
understanding
of
his
position
certain
essential
fact
which
required
immediate
consideration
were
particularly
irksome
to
him
how
glad
he
would
have
been
to
be
free
from
some
care
the
neglect
of
which
would
have
threatened
him
with
complete
inevitable
ruin
he
wa
particularly
worried
about
svidrigaïlov
he
might
be
said
to
be
permanently
thinking
of
svidrigaïlov
from
the
time
of
svidrigaïlov
s
too
menacing
and
unmistakable
word
in
sonia
s
room
at
the
moment
of
katerina
ivanovna
s
death
the
normal
working
of
his
mind
seemed
to
break
down
but
although
this
new
fact
caused
him
extreme
uneasiness
raskolnikov
wa
in
no
hurry
for
an
explanation
of
it
at
time
finding
himself
in
a
solitary
and
remote
part
of
the
town
in
some
wretched
sitting
alone
lost
in
thought
hardly
knowing
how
he
had
come
there
he
suddenly
thought
of
svidrigaïlov
he
recognised
suddenly
clearly
and
with
dismay
that
he
ought
at
once
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
that
man
and
to
make
what
term
he
could
walking
outside
the
city
gate
one
day
he
positively
fancied
that
they
had
fixed
a
meeting
there
that
he
wa
waiting
for
svidrigaïlov
another
time
he
woke
up
before
daybreak
lying
on
the
ground
under
some
bush
and
could
not
at
first
understand
how
he
had
come
there
but
during
the
two
or
three
day
after
katerina
ivanovna
s
death
he
had
two
or
three
time
met
svidrigaïlov
at
sonia
s
lodging
where
he
had
gone
aimlessly
for
a
moment
they
exchanged
a
few
word
and
made
no
reference
to
the
vital
subject
a
though
they
were
tacitly
agreed
not
to
speak
of
it
for
a
time
katerina
ivanovna
s
body
wa
still
lying
in
the
coffin
svidrigaïlov
wa
busy
making
arrangement
for
the
funeral
sonia
too
wa
very
busy
at
their
last
meeting
svidrigaïlov
informed
raskolnikov
that
he
had
made
an
arrangement
and
a
very
satisfactory
one
for
katerina
ivanovna
s
child
that
he
had
through
certain
connection
succeeded
in
getting
hold
of
certain
personage
by
whose
help
the
three
orphan
could
be
at
once
placed
in
very
suitable
institution
that
the
money
he
had
settled
on
them
had
been
of
great
assistance
a
it
is
much
easier
to
place
orphan
with
some
property
than
destitute
one
he
said
something
too
about
sonia
and
promised
to
come
himself
in
a
day
or
two
to
see
raskolnikov
mentioning
that
he
would
like
to
consult
with
him
that
there
were
thing
they
must
talk
over
this
conversation
took
place
in
the
passage
on
the
stair
svidrigaïlov
looked
intently
at
raskolnikov
and
suddenly
after
a
brief
pause
dropping
his
voice
asked
but
how
is
it
rodion
romanovitch
you
don
t
seem
yourself
you
look
and
you
listen
but
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
cheer
up
we
ll
talk
thing
over
i
am
only
sorry
i
ve
so
much
to
do
of
my
own
business
and
other
people
s
ah
rodion
romanovitch
he
added
suddenly
what
all
men
need
is
fresh
air
fresh
air
more
than
anything
he
moved
to
one
side
to
make
way
for
the
priest
and
server
who
were
coming
up
the
stair
they
had
come
for
the
requiem
service
by
svidrigaïlov
s
order
it
wa
sung
twice
a
day
punctually
svidrigaïlov
went
his
way
raskolnikov
stood
still
a
moment
thought
and
followed
the
priest
into
sonia
s
room
he
stood
at
the
door
they
began
quietly
slowly
and
mournfully
singing
the
service
from
his
childhood
the
thought
of
death
and
the
presence
of
death
had
something
oppressive
and
mysteriously
awful
and
it
wa
long
since
he
had
heard
the
requiem
service
and
there
wa
something
else
here
a
well
too
awful
and
disturbing
he
looked
at
the
child
they
were
all
kneeling
by
the
coffin
polenka
wa
weeping
behind
them
sonia
prayed
softly
and
a
it
were
timidly
weeping
these
last
two
day
she
hasn
t
said
a
word
to
me
she
hasn
t
glanced
at
me
raskolnikov
thought
suddenly
the
sunlight
wa
bright
in
the
room
the
incense
rose
in
cloud
the
priest
read
give
rest
oh
lord
raskolnikov
stayed
all
through
the
service
a
he
blessed
them
and
took
his
leave
the
priest
looked
round
strangely
after
the
service
raskolnikov
went
up
to
sonia
she
took
both
his
hand
and
let
her
head
sink
on
his
shoulder
this
slight
friendly
gesture
bewildered
raskolnikov
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
there
wa
no
trace
of
repugnance
no
trace
of
disgust
no
tremor
in
her
hand
it
wa
the
furthest
limit
of
at
least
so
he
interpreted
it
sonia
said
nothing
raskolnikov
pressed
her
hand
and
went
out
he
felt
very
miserable
if
it
had
been
possible
to
escape
to
some
solitude
he
would
have
thought
himself
lucky
even
if
he
had
to
spend
his
whole
life
there
but
although
he
had
almost
always
been
by
himself
of
late
he
had
never
been
able
to
feel
alone
sometimes
he
walked
out
of
the
town
on
to
the
high
road
once
he
had
even
reached
a
little
wood
but
the
lonelier
the
place
wa
the
more
he
seemed
to
be
aware
of
an
uneasy
presence
near
him
it
did
not
frighten
him
but
greatly
annoyed
him
so
that
he
made
haste
to
return
to
the
town
to
mingle
with
the
crowd
to
enter
restaurant
and
tavern
to
walk
in
busy
thoroughfare
there
he
felt
easier
and
even
more
solitary
one
day
at
dusk
he
sat
for
an
hour
listening
to
song
in
a
tavern
and
he
remembered
that
he
positively
enjoyed
it
but
at
last
he
had
suddenly
felt
the
same
uneasiness
again
a
though
his
conscience
smote
him
here
i
sit
listening
to
singing
is
that
what
i
ought
to
be
doing
he
thought
yet
he
felt
at
once
that
that
wa
not
the
only
cause
of
his
uneasiness
there
wa
something
requiring
immediate
decision
but
it
wa
something
he
could
not
clearly
understand
or
put
into
word
it
wa
a
hopeless
tangle
no
better
the
struggle
again
better
porfiry
again
or
svidrigaïlov
better
some
challenge
again
some
attack
yes
yes
he
thought
he
went
out
of
the
tavern
and
rushed
away
almost
at
a
run
the
thought
of
dounia
and
his
mother
suddenly
reduced
him
almost
to
a
panic
that
night
he
woke
up
before
morning
among
some
bush
in
krestovsky
island
trembling
all
over
with
fever
he
walked
home
and
it
wa
early
morning
when
he
arrived
after
some
hour
sleep
the
fever
left
him
but
he
woke
up
late
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
he
remembered
that
katerina
ivanovna
s
funeral
had
been
fixed
for
that
day
and
wa
glad
that
he
wa
not
present
at
it
nastasya
brought
him
some
food
he
ate
and
drank
with
appetite
almost
with
greediness
his
head
wa
fresher
and
he
wa
calmer
than
he
had
been
for
the
last
three
day
he
even
felt
a
passing
wonder
at
his
previous
attack
of
panic
the
door
opened
and
razumihin
came
in
ah
he
s
eating
then
he
s
not
ill
said
razumihin
he
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
at
the
table
opposite
raskolnikov
he
wa
troubled
and
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
he
spoke
with
evident
annoyance
but
without
hurry
or
raising
his
voice
he
looked
a
though
he
had
some
special
fixed
determination
listen
he
began
resolutely
a
far
a
i
am
concerned
you
may
all
go
to
hell
but
from
what
i
see
it
s
clear
to
me
that
i
can
t
make
head
or
tail
of
it
please
don
t
think
i
ve
come
to
ask
you
question
i
don
t
want
to
know
hang
it
if
you
begin
telling
me
your
secret
i
dare
say
i
shouldn
t
stay
to
listen
i
should
go
away
cursing
i
have
only
come
to
find
out
once
for
all
whether
it
s
a
fact
that
you
are
mad
there
is
a
conviction
in
the
air
that
you
are
mad
or
very
nearly
so
i
admit
i
ve
been
disposed
to
that
opinion
myself
judging
from
your
stupid
repulsive
and
quite
inexplicable
action
and
from
your
recent
behavior
to
your
mother
and
sister
only
a
monster
or
a
madman
could
treat
them
a
you
have
so
you
must
be
when
did
you
see
them
last
just
now
haven
t
you
seen
them
since
then
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
tell
me
please
i
ve
been
to
you
three
time
already
your
mother
ha
been
seriously
ill
since
yesterday
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
come
to
you
avdotya
romanovna
tried
to
prevent
her
she
wouldn
t
hear
a
word
if
he
is
ill
if
his
mind
is
giving
way
who
can
look
after
him
like
his
mother
she
said
we
all
came
here
together
we
couldn
t
let
her
come
alone
all
the
way
we
kept
begging
her
to
be
calm
we
came
in
you
weren
t
here
she
sat
down
and
stayed
ten
minute
while
we
stood
waiting
in
silence
she
got
up
and
said
if
he
s
gone
out
that
is
if
he
is
well
and
ha
forgotten
his
mother
it
s
humiliating
and
unseemly
for
his
mother
to
stand
at
his
door
begging
for
she
returned
home
and
took
to
her
bed
now
she
is
in
a
fever
i
see
she
said
that
he
ha
time
for
she
mean
by
sofya
semyonovna
your
betrothed
or
your
mistress
i
don
t
know
i
went
at
once
to
sofya
semyonovna
s
for
i
wanted
to
know
what
wa
going
on
i
looked
round
i
saw
the
coffin
the
child
cry
and
sofya
semyonovna
trying
them
on
mourning
dress
no
sign
of
you
i
apologised
came
away
and
reported
to
avdotya
romanovna
so
that
s
all
nonsense
and
you
haven
t
got
a
girl
the
most
likely
thing
is
that
you
are
mad
but
here
you
sit
guzzling
boiled
beef
a
though
you
d
not
had
a
bite
for
three
day
though
a
far
a
that
go
madman
eat
too
but
though
you
have
not
said
a
word
to
me
yet
you
are
not
mad
that
i
d
swear
above
all
you
are
not
mad
so
you
may
go
to
hell
all
of
you
for
there
s
some
mystery
some
secret
about
it
and
i
don
t
intend
to
worry
my
brain
over
your
secret
so
i
ve
simply
come
to
swear
at
you
he
finished
getting
up
to
relieve
my
mind
and
i
know
what
to
do
what
do
you
mean
to
do
now
what
business
is
it
of
yours
what
i
mean
to
do
you
are
going
in
for
a
drinking
how
how
did
you
know
why
it
s
pretty
razumihin
paused
for
a
minute
you
always
have
been
a
very
rational
person
and
you
ve
never
been
mad
never
he
observed
suddenly
with
warmth
you
re
right
i
shall
drink
and
he
moved
to
go
out
i
wa
talking
with
my
sister
the
day
before
yesterday
i
think
it
wa
about
you
about
me
but
where
can
you
have
seen
her
the
day
before
yesterday
razumihin
stopped
short
and
even
turned
a
little
pale
one
could
see
that
his
heart
wa
throbbing
slowly
and
violently
she
came
here
by
herself
sat
there
and
talked
to
she
did
what
did
you
say
to
her
i
mean
about
me
i
told
her
you
were
a
very
good
honest
and
industrious
man
i
didn
t
tell
her
you
love
her
because
she
know
that
she
know
that
herself
well
it
s
pretty
plain
wherever
i
might
go
whatever
happened
to
me
you
would
remain
to
look
after
them
i
so
to
speak
give
them
into
your
keeping
razumihin
i
say
this
because
i
know
quite
well
how
you
love
her
and
am
convinced
of
the
purity
of
your
heart
i
know
that
she
too
may
love
you
and
perhaps
doe
love
you
already
now
decide
for
yourself
a
you
know
best
whether
you
need
go
in
for
a
drinking
bout
or
rodya
you
see
well
ach
damn
it
but
where
do
you
mean
to
go
of
course
if
it
s
all
a
secret
never
mind
but
i
i
shall
find
out
the
secret
and
i
am
sure
that
it
must
be
some
ridiculous
nonsense
and
that
you
ve
made
it
all
up
anyway
you
are
a
capital
fellow
a
capital
fellow
that
wa
just
what
i
wanted
to
add
only
you
interrupted
that
that
wa
a
very
good
decision
of
yours
not
to
find
out
these
secret
leave
it
to
time
don
t
worry
about
it
you
ll
know
it
all
in
time
when
it
must
be
yesterday
a
man
said
to
me
that
what
a
man
need
is
fresh
air
fresh
air
fresh
air
i
mean
to
go
to
him
directly
to
find
out
what
he
meant
by
razumihin
stood
lost
in
thought
and
excitement
making
a
silent
conclusion
he
s
a
political
conspirator
he
must
be
and
he
s
on
the
eve
of
some
desperate
step
that
s
certain
it
can
only
be
that
and
and
dounia
know
he
thought
suddenly
so
avdotya
romanovna
come
to
see
you
he
said
weighing
each
syllable
and
you
re
going
to
see
a
man
who
say
we
need
more
air
and
so
of
course
that
letter
that
too
must
have
something
to
do
with
it
he
concluded
to
himself
what
letter
she
got
a
letter
it
upset
her
very
much
very
much
indeed
too
much
so
i
began
speaking
of
you
she
begged
me
not
to
then
then
she
said
that
perhaps
we
should
very
soon
have
to
part
then
she
began
warmly
thanking
me
for
something
then
she
went
to
her
room
and
locked
herself
she
got
a
letter
raskolnikov
asked
thoughtfully
yes
and
you
didn
t
know
hm
they
were
both
silent
rodion
there
wa
a
time
brother
when
i
never
mind
you
see
there
wa
a
time
well
i
must
be
off
too
i
am
not
going
to
drink
there
s
no
need
now
that
s
all
stuff
he
hurried
out
but
when
he
had
almost
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
suddenly
opened
it
again
and
said
looking
away
oh
by
the
way
do
you
remember
that
murder
you
know
porfiry
s
that
old
woman
do
you
know
the
murderer
ha
been
found
he
ha
confessed
and
given
the
proof
it
s
one
of
those
very
workman
the
painter
only
fancy
do
you
remember
i
defended
them
here
would
you
believe
it
all
that
scene
of
fighting
and
laughing
with
his
companion
on
the
stair
while
the
porter
and
the
two
witness
were
going
up
he
got
up
on
purpose
to
disarm
suspicion
the
cunning
the
presence
of
mind
of
the
young
dog
one
can
hardly
credit
it
but
it
s
his
own
explanation
he
ha
confessed
it
all
and
what
a
fool
i
wa
about
it
well
he
s
simply
a
genius
of
hypocrisy
and
resourcefulness
in
disarming
the
suspicion
of
the
lawyer
so
there
s
nothing
much
to
wonder
at
i
suppose
of
course
people
like
that
are
always
possible
and
the
fact
that
he
couldn
t
keep
up
the
character
but
confessed
make
him
easier
to
believe
in
but
what
a
fool
i
wa
i
wa
frantic
on
their
side
tell
me
please
from
whom
did
you
hear
that
and
why
doe
it
interest
you
so
raskolnikov
asked
with
unmistakable
agitation
what
next
you
ask
me
why
it
interest
me
well
i
heard
it
from
porfiry
among
others
it
wa
from
him
i
heard
almost
all
about
from
porfiry
from
what
what
did
he
say
raskolnikov
asked
in
dismay
he
gave
me
a
capital
explanation
of
it
psychologically
after
his
he
explained
it
explained
it
himself
yes
yes
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
but
now
i
m
busy
there
wa
a
time
when
i
fancied
but
no
matter
another
time
what
need
is
there
for
me
to
drink
now
you
have
made
me
drunk
without
wine
i
am
drunk
rodya
i
m
going
i
ll
come
again
very
he
went
out
he
s
a
political
conspirator
there
s
not
a
doubt
about
it
razumihin
decided
a
he
slowly
descended
the
stair
and
he
s
drawn
his
sister
in
that
s
quite
quite
in
keeping
with
avdotya
romanovna
s
character
there
are
interview
between
them
she
hinted
at
it
too
so
many
of
her
word
and
hint
bear
that
meaning
and
how
else
can
all
this
tangle
be
explained
hm
and
i
wa
almost
thinking
good
heaven
what
i
thought
yes
i
took
leave
of
my
sens
and
i
wronged
him
it
wa
his
doing
under
the
lamp
in
the
corridor
that
day
pfoo
what
a
crude
nasty
vile
idea
on
my
part
nikolay
is
a
brick
for
confessing
and
how
clear
it
all
is
now
his
illness
then
all
his
strange
action
before
this
in
the
university
how
morose
he
used
to
be
how
gloomy
but
what
s
the
meaning
now
of
that
letter
there
s
something
in
that
too
perhaps
whom
wa
it
from
i
suspect
no
i
must
find
out
he
thought
of
dounia
realising
all
he
had
heard
and
his
heart
throbbed
and
he
suddenly
broke
into
a
run
a
soon
a
razumihin
went
out
raskolnikov
got
up
turned
to
the
window
walked
into
one
corner
and
then
into
another
a
though
forgetting
the
smallness
of
his
room
and
sat
down
again
on
the
sofa
he
felt
so
to
speak
renewed
again
the
struggle
so
a
mean
of
escape
had
come
yes
a
mean
of
escape
had
come
it
had
been
too
stifling
too
cramping
the
burden
had
been
too
agonising
a
lethargy
had
come
upon
him
at
time
from
the
moment
of
the
scene
with
nikolay
at
porfiry
s
he
had
been
suffocating
penned
in
without
hope
of
escape
after
nikolay
s
confession
on
that
very
day
had
come
the
scene
with
sonia
his
behaviour
and
his
last
word
had
been
utterly
unlike
anything
he
could
have
imagined
beforehand
he
had
grown
feebler
instantly
and
fundamentally
and
he
had
agreed
at
the
time
with
sonia
he
had
agreed
in
his
heart
he
could
not
go
on
living
alone
with
such
a
thing
on
his
mind
and
svidrigaïlov
wa
a
riddle
he
worried
him
that
wa
true
but
somehow
not
on
the
same
point
he
might
still
have
a
struggle
to
come
with
svidrigaïlov
svidrigaïlov
too
might
be
a
mean
of
escape
but
porfiry
wa
a
different
matter
and
so
porfiry
himself
had
explained
it
to
razumihin
had
explained
it
he
had
begun
bringing
in
his
damned
psychology
again
porfiry
but
to
think
that
porfiry
should
for
one
moment
believe
that
nikolay
wa
guilty
after
what
had
passed
between
them
before
nikolay
s
appearance
after
that
interview
which
could
have
only
explanation
during
those
day
raskolnikov
had
often
recalled
passage
in
that
scene
with
porfiry
he
could
not
bear
to
let
his
mind
rest
on
it
such
word
such
gesture
had
passed
between
them
they
had
exchanged
such
glance
thing
had
been
said
in
such
a
tone
and
had
reached
such
a
pas
that
nikolay
whom
porfiry
had
seen
through
at
the
first
word
at
the
first
gesture
could
not
have
shaken
his
conviction
and
to
think
that
even
razumihin
had
begun
to
suspect
the
scene
in
the
corridor
under
the
lamp
had
produced
it
effect
then
he
had
rushed
to
porfiry
but
what
had
induced
the
latter
to
receive
him
like
that
what
had
been
his
object
in
putting
razumihin
off
with
nikolay
he
must
have
some
plan
there
wa
some
design
but
what
wa
it
it
wa
true
that
a
long
time
had
passed
since
that
morning
too
long
a
time
and
no
sight
nor
sound
of
porfiry
well
that
wa
a
bad
sign
raskolnikov
took
his
cap
and
went
out
of
the
room
still
pondering
it
wa
the
first
time
for
a
long
while
that
he
had
felt
clear
in
his
mind
at
least
i
must
settle
svidrigaïlov
he
thought
and
a
soon
a
possible
he
too
seems
to
be
waiting
for
me
to
come
to
him
of
my
own
and
at
that
moment
there
wa
such
a
rush
of
hate
in
his
weary
heart
that
he
might
have
killed
either
of
those
two
porfiry
or
svidrigaïlov
at
least
he
felt
that
he
would
be
capable
of
doing
it
later
if
not
now
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
he
repeated
to
himself
but
no
sooner
had
he
opened
the
door
than
he
stumbled
upon
porfiry
himself
in
the
passage
he
wa
coming
in
to
see
him
raskolnikov
wa
dumbfounded
for
a
minute
but
only
for
one
minute
strange
to
say
he
wa
not
very
much
astonished
at
seeing
porfiry
and
scarcely
afraid
of
him
he
wa
simply
startled
but
wa
quickly
instantly
on
his
guard
perhaps
this
will
mean
the
end
but
how
could
porfiry
have
approached
so
quietly
like
a
cat
so
that
he
had
heard
nothing
could
he
have
been
listening
at
the
door
you
didn
t
expect
a
visitor
rodion
romanovitch
porfiry
explained
laughing
i
ve
been
meaning
to
look
in
a
long
time
i
wa
passing
by
and
thought
why
not
go
in
for
five
minute
are
you
going
out
i
won
t
keep
you
long
just
let
me
have
one
sit
down
porfiry
petrovitch
sit
raskolnikov
gave
his
visitor
a
seat
with
so
pleased
and
friendly
an
expression
that
he
would
have
marvelled
at
himself
if
he
could
have
seen
it
the
last
moment
had
come
the
last
drop
had
to
be
drained
so
a
man
will
sometimes
go
through
half
an
hour
of
mortal
terror
with
a
brigand
yet
when
the
knife
is
at
his
throat
at
last
he
feel
no
fear
raskolnikov
seated
himself
directly
facing
porfiry
and
looked
at
him
without
flinching
porfiry
screwed
up
his
eye
and
began
lighting
a
cigarette
speak
speak
seemed
a
though
it
would
burst
from
raskolnikov
s
heart
come
why
don
t
you
speak
chapter
ii
ah
these
cigarette
porfiry
petrovitch
ejaculated
at
last
having
lighted
one
they
are
pernicious
positively
pernicious
and
yet
i
can
t
give
them
up
i
cough
i
begin
to
have
tickling
in
my
throat
and
a
difficulty
in
breathing
you
know
i
am
a
coward
i
went
lately
to
b
n
he
always
give
at
least
half
an
hour
to
each
patient
he
positively
laughed
looking
at
me
he
sounded
me
tobacco
s
bad
for
you
he
said
your
lung
are
but
how
am
i
to
give
it
up
what
is
there
to
take
it
place
i
don
t
drink
that
s
the
mischief
that
i
don
t
everything
is
relative
rodion
romanovitch
everything
is
relative
why
he
s
playing
his
professional
trick
again
raskolnikov
thought
with
disgust
all
the
circumstance
of
their
last
interview
suddenly
came
back
to
him
and
he
felt
a
rush
of
the
feeling
that
had
come
upon
him
then
i
came
to
see
you
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
evening
you
didn
t
know
porfiry
petrovitch
went
on
looking
round
the
room
i
came
into
this
very
room
i
wa
passing
by
just
a
i
did
and
i
thought
i
d
return
your
call
i
walked
in
a
your
door
wa
wide
open
i
looked
round
waited
and
went
out
without
leaving
my
name
with
your
servant
don
t
you
lock
your
door
raskolnikov
s
face
grew
more
and
more
gloomy
porfiry
seemed
to
guess
his
state
of
mind
i
ve
come
to
have
it
out
with
you
rodion
romanovitch
my
dear
fellow
i
owe
you
an
explanation
and
must
give
it
to
you
he
continued
with
a
slight
smile
just
patting
raskolnikov
s
knee
but
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
serious
and
careworn
look
came
into
his
face
to
his
surprise
raskolnikov
saw
a
touch
of
sadness
in
it
he
had
never
seen
and
never
suspected
such
an
expression
in
his
face
a
strange
scene
passed
between
u
last
time
we
met
rodion
romanovitch
our
first
interview
too
wa
a
strange
one
but
then
and
one
thing
after
another
this
is
the
point
i
have
perhaps
acted
unfairly
to
you
i
feel
it
do
you
remember
how
we
parted
your
nerve
were
unhinged
and
your
knee
were
shaking
and
so
were
mine
and
you
know
our
behaviour
wa
unseemly
even
ungentlemanly
and
yet
we
are
gentleman
above
all
in
any
case
gentleman
that
must
be
understood
do
you
remember
what
we
came
to
and
it
wa
quite
what
is
he
up
to
what
doe
he
take
me
for
raskolnikov
asked
himself
in
amazement
raising
his
head
and
looking
with
open
eye
on
porfiry
i
ve
decided
openness
is
better
between
u
porfiry
petrovitch
went
on
turning
his
head
away
and
dropping
his
eye
a
though
unwilling
to
disconcert
his
former
victim
and
a
though
disdaining
his
former
wile
yes
such
suspicion
and
such
scene
can
not
continue
for
long
nikolay
put
a
stop
to
it
or
i
don
t
know
what
we
might
not
have
come
to
that
damned
workman
wa
sitting
at
the
time
in
the
next
room
can
you
realise
that
you
know
that
of
course
and
i
am
aware
that
he
came
to
you
afterwards
but
what
you
supposed
then
wa
not
true
i
had
not
sent
for
anyone
i
had
made
no
kind
of
arrangement
you
ask
why
i
hadn
t
what
shall
i
say
to
you
it
had
all
come
upon
me
so
suddenly
i
had
scarcely
sent
for
the
porter
you
noticed
them
a
you
went
out
i
dare
say
an
idea
flashed
upon
me
i
wa
firmly
convinced
at
the
time
you
see
rodion
romanovitch
come
i
thought
even
if
i
let
one
thing
slip
for
a
time
i
shall
get
hold
of
something
else
i
shan
t
lose
what
i
want
anyway
you
are
nervously
irritable
rodion
romanovitch
by
temperament
it
s
out
of
proportion
with
other
quality
of
your
heart
and
character
which
i
flatter
myself
i
have
to
some
extent
divined
of
course
i
did
reflect
even
then
that
it
doe
not
always
happen
that
a
man
get
up
and
blurts
out
his
whole
story
it
doe
happen
sometimes
if
you
make
a
man
lose
all
patience
though
even
then
it
s
rare
i
wa
capable
of
realising
that
if
i
only
had
a
fact
i
thought
the
least
little
fact
to
go
upon
something
i
could
lay
hold
of
something
tangible
not
merely
psychological
for
if
a
man
is
guilty
you
must
be
able
to
get
something
substantial
out
of
him
one
may
reckon
upon
most
surprising
result
indeed
i
wa
reckoning
on
your
temperament
rodion
romanovitch
on
your
temperament
above
all
thing
i
had
great
hope
of
you
at
that
but
what
are
you
driving
at
now
raskolnikov
muttered
at
last
asking
the
question
without
thinking
what
is
he
talking
about
he
wondered
distractedly
doe
he
really
take
me
to
be
innocent
what
am
i
driving
at
i
ve
come
to
explain
myself
i
consider
it
my
duty
so
to
speak
i
want
to
make
clear
to
you
how
the
whole
business
the
whole
misunderstanding
arose
i
ve
caused
you
a
great
deal
of
suffering
rodion
romanovitch
i
am
not
a
monster
i
understand
what
it
must
mean
for
a
man
who
ha
been
unfortunate
but
who
is
proud
imperious
and
above
all
impatient
to
have
to
bear
such
treatment
i
regard
you
in
any
case
a
a
man
of
noble
character
and
not
without
element
of
magnanimity
though
i
don
t
agree
with
all
your
conviction
i
wanted
to
tell
you
this
first
frankly
and
quite
sincerely
for
above
all
i
don
t
want
to
deceive
you
when
i
made
your
acquaintance
i
felt
attracted
by
you
perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
my
saying
so
you
have
a
right
to
i
know
you
disliked
me
from
the
first
and
indeed
you
ve
no
reason
to
like
me
you
may
think
what
you
like
but
i
desire
now
to
do
all
i
can
to
efface
that
impression
and
to
show
that
i
am
a
man
of
heart
and
conscience
i
speak
porfiry
petrovitch
made
a
dignified
pause
raskolnikov
felt
a
rush
of
renewed
alarm
the
thought
that
porfiry
believed
him
to
be
innocent
began
to
make
him
uneasy
it
s
scarcely
necessary
to
go
over
everything
in
detail
porfiry
petrovitch
went
on
indeed
i
could
scarcely
attempt
it
to
begin
with
there
were
rumour
through
whom
how
and
when
those
rumour
came
to
me
and
how
they
affected
you
i
need
not
go
into
my
suspicion
were
aroused
by
a
complete
accident
which
might
just
a
easily
not
have
happened
what
wa
it
hm
i
believe
there
is
no
need
to
go
into
that
either
those
rumour
and
that
accident
led
to
one
idea
in
my
mind
i
admit
it
openly
for
one
may
a
well
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
wa
the
first
to
pitch
on
you
the
old
woman
s
note
on
the
pledge
and
the
rest
of
it
that
all
came
to
nothing
yours
wa
one
of
a
hundred
i
happened
too
to
hear
of
the
scene
at
the
office
from
a
man
who
described
it
capitally
unconsciously
reproducing
the
scene
with
great
vividness
it
wa
just
one
thing
after
another
rodion
romanovitch
my
dear
fellow
how
could
i
avoid
being
brought
to
certain
idea
from
a
hundred
rabbit
you
can
t
make
a
horse
a
hundred
suspicion
don
t
make
a
proof
a
the
english
proverb
say
but
that
s
only
from
the
rational
point
of
view
you
can
t
help
being
partial
for
after
all
a
lawyer
is
only
human
i
thought
too
of
your
article
in
that
journal
do
you
remember
on
your
first
visit
we
talked
of
it
i
jeered
at
you
at
the
time
but
that
wa
only
to
lead
you
on
i
repeat
rodion
romanovitch
you
are
ill
and
impatient
that
you
were
bold
headstrong
in
earnest
and
had
felt
a
great
deal
i
recognised
long
before
i
too
have
felt
the
same
so
that
your
article
seemed
familiar
to
me
it
wa
conceived
on
sleepless
night
with
a
throbbing
heart
in
ecstasy
and
suppressed
enthusiasm
and
that
proud
suppressed
enthusiasm
in
young
people
is
dangerous
i
jeered
at
you
then
but
let
me
tell
you
that
a
a
literary
amateur
i
am
awfully
fond
of
such
first
essay
full
of
the
heat
of
youth
there
is
a
mistiness
and
a
chord
vibrating
in
the
mist
your
article
is
absurd
and
fantastic
but
there
s
a
transparent
sincerity
a
youthful
incorruptible
pride
and
the
daring
of
despair
in
it
it
s
a
gloomy
article
but
that
s
what
s
fine
in
it
i
read
your
article
and
put
it
aside
thinking
a
i
did
so
that
man
won
t
go
the
common
well
i
ask
you
after
that
a
a
preliminary
how
could
i
help
being
carried
away
by
what
followed
oh
dear
i
am
not
saying
anything
i
am
not
making
any
statement
now
i
simply
noted
it
at
the
time
what
is
there
in
it
i
reflected
there
s
nothing
in
it
that
is
really
nothing
and
perhaps
absolutely
nothing
and
it
s
not
at
all
the
thing
for
the
prosecutor
to
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
notion
here
i
have
nikolay
on
my
hand
with
actual
evidence
against
him
you
may
think
what
you
like
of
it
but
it
s
evidence
he
brings
in
his
psychology
too
one
ha
to
consider
him
too
for
it
s
a
matter
of
life
and
death
why
am
i
explaining
this
to
you
that
you
may
understand
and
not
blame
my
malicious
behaviour
on
that
occasion
it
wa
not
malicious
i
assure
you
do
you
suppose
i
didn
t
come
to
search
your
room
at
the
time
i
did
i
did
i
wa
here
when
you
were
lying
ill
in
bed
not
officially
not
in
my
own
person
but
i
wa
here
your
room
wa
searched
to
the
last
thread
at
the
first
suspicion
but
i
thought
to
myself
now
that
man
will
come
will
come
of
himself
and
quickly
too
if
he
s
guilty
he
s
sure
to
come
another
man
wouldn
t
but
he
will
and
you
remember
how
razumihin
began
discussing
the
subject
with
you
we
arranged
that
to
excite
you
so
we
purposely
spread
rumour
that
he
might
discus
the
case
with
you
and
razumihin
is
not
a
man
to
restrain
his
indignation
zametov
wa
tremendously
struck
by
your
anger
and
your
open
daring
think
of
blurting
out
in
a
restaurant
i
killed
it
wa
too
daring
too
reckless
i
thought
so
myself
if
he
is
guilty
he
will
be
a
formidable
opponent
that
wa
what
i
thought
at
the
time
i
wa
expecting
you
but
you
simply
bowled
zametov
over
and
well
you
see
it
all
lie
in
this
that
this
damnable
psychology
can
be
taken
two
way
well
i
kept
expecting
you
and
so
it
wa
you
came
my
heart
wa
fairly
throbbing
ach
now
why
need
you
have
come
your
laughter
too
a
you
came
in
do
you
remember
i
saw
it
all
plain
a
daylight
but
if
i
hadn
t
expected
you
so
specially
i
should
not
have
noticed
anything
in
your
laughter
you
see
what
influence
a
mood
ha
razumihin
then
ah
that
stone
that
stone
under
which
the
thing
were
hidden
i
seem
to
see
it
somewhere
in
a
kitchen
garden
it
wa
in
a
kitchen
garden
you
told
zametov
and
afterwards
you
repeated
that
in
my
office
and
when
we
began
picking
your
article
to
piece
how
you
explained
it
one
could
take
every
word
of
yours
in
two
sens
a
though
there
were
another
meaning
hidden
so
in
this
way
rodion
romanovitch
i
reached
the
furthest
limit
and
knocking
my
head
against
a
post
i
pulled
myself
up
asking
myself
what
i
wa
about
after
all
i
said
you
can
take
it
all
in
another
sense
if
you
like
and
it
s
more
natural
so
indeed
i
couldn
t
help
admitting
it
wa
more
natural
i
wa
bothered
no
i
d
better
get
hold
of
some
little
fact
i
said
so
when
i
heard
of
the
i
held
my
breath
and
wa
all
in
a
tremor
here
is
my
little
fact
thought
i
and
i
didn
t
think
it
over
i
simply
wouldn
t
i
would
have
given
a
thousand
rouble
at
that
minute
to
have
seen
you
with
my
own
eye
when
you
walked
a
hundred
pace
beside
that
workman
after
he
had
called
you
murderer
to
your
face
and
you
did
not
dare
to
ask
him
a
question
all
the
way
and
then
what
about
your
trembling
what
about
your
in
your
illness
in
and
so
rodion
romanovitch
can
you
wonder
that
i
played
such
prank
on
you
and
what
made
you
come
at
that
very
minute
someone
seemed
to
have
sent
you
by
jove
and
if
nikolay
had
not
parted
u
and
do
you
remember
nikolay
at
the
time
do
you
remember
him
clearly
it
wa
a
thunderbolt
a
regular
thunderbolt
and
how
i
met
him
i
didn
t
believe
in
the
thunderbolt
not
for
a
minute
you
could
see
it
for
yourself
and
how
could
i
even
afterwards
when
you
had
gone
and
he
began
making
very
very
plausible
answer
on
certain
point
so
that
i
wa
surprised
at
him
myself
even
then
i
didn
t
believe
his
story
you
see
what
it
is
to
be
a
firm
a
a
rock
no
thought
i
what
ha
nikolay
got
to
do
with
it
razumihin
told
me
just
now
that
you
think
nikolay
guilty
and
had
yourself
assured
him
of
it
his
voice
failed
him
and
he
broke
off
he
had
been
listening
in
indescribable
agitation
a
this
man
who
had
seen
through
and
through
him
went
back
upon
himself
he
wa
afraid
of
believing
it
and
did
not
believe
it
in
those
still
ambiguous
word
he
kept
eagerly
looking
for
something
more
definite
and
conclusive
mr
razumihin
cried
porfiry
petrovitch
seeming
glad
of
a
question
from
raskolnikov
who
had
till
then
been
silent
but
i
had
to
put
razumihin
off
two
is
company
three
is
none
razumihin
is
not
the
right
man
besides
he
is
an
outsider
he
came
running
to
me
with
a
pale
face
but
never
mind
him
why
bring
him
in
to
return
to
nikolay
would
you
like
to
know
what
sort
of
a
type
he
is
how
i
understand
him
that
is
to
begin
with
he
is
still
a
child
and
not
exactly
a
coward
but
something
by
way
of
an
artist
really
don
t
laugh
at
my
describing
him
so
he
is
innocent
and
responsive
to
influence
he
ha
a
heart
and
is
a
fantastic
fellow
he
sings
and
dance
he
tell
story
they
say
so
that
people
come
from
other
village
to
hear
him
he
attends
school
too
and
laugh
till
he
cry
if
you
hold
up
a
finger
to
him
he
will
drink
himself
senseless
not
a
a
regular
vice
but
at
time
when
people
treat
him
like
a
child
and
he
stole
too
then
without
knowing
it
himself
for
how
can
it
be
stealing
if
one
pick
it
up
and
do
you
know
he
is
an
old
believer
or
rather
a
dissenter
there
have
been
wanderer
in
his
family
and
he
wa
for
two
year
in
his
village
under
the
spiritual
guidance
of
a
certain
elder
i
learnt
all
this
from
nikolay
and
from
his
fellow
villager
and
what
s
more
he
wanted
to
run
into
the
wilderness
he
wa
full
of
fervour
prayed
at
night
read
the
old
book
the
true
one
and
read
himself
crazy
a
religious
translator
s
note
petersburg
had
a
great
effect
upon
him
especially
the
woman
and
the
wine
he
responds
to
everything
and
he
forgot
the
elder
and
all
that
i
learnt
that
an
artist
here
took
a
fancy
to
him
and
used
to
go
and
see
him
and
now
this
business
came
upon
him
well
he
wa
frightened
he
tried
to
hang
himself
he
ran
away
how
can
one
get
over
the
idea
the
people
have
of
russian
legal
proceeding
the
very
word
trial
frightens
some
of
them
whose
fault
is
it
we
shall
see
what
the
new
jury
will
do
god
grant
they
do
good
well
in
prison
it
seems
he
remembered
the
venerable
elder
the
bible
too
made
it
appearance
again
do
you
know
rodion
romanovitch
the
force
of
the
word
suffering
among
some
of
these
people
it
s
not
a
question
of
suffering
for
someone
s
benefit
but
simply
one
must
if
they
suffer
at
the
hand
of
the
authority
so
much
the
better
in
my
time
there
wa
a
very
meek
and
mild
prisoner
who
spent
a
whole
year
in
prison
always
reading
his
bible
on
the
stove
at
night
and
he
read
himself
crazy
and
so
crazy
do
you
know
that
one
day
apropos
of
nothing
he
seized
a
brick
and
flung
it
at
the
governor
though
he
had
done
him
no
harm
and
the
way
he
threw
it
too
aimed
it
a
yard
on
one
side
on
purpose
for
fear
of
hurting
him
well
we
know
what
happens
to
a
prisoner
who
assault
an
officer
with
a
weapon
so
he
took
his
so
i
suspect
now
that
nikolay
want
to
take
his
suffering
or
something
of
the
sort
i
know
it
for
certain
from
fact
indeed
only
he
doesn
t
know
that
i
know
what
you
don
t
admit
that
there
are
such
fantastic
people
among
the
peasant
lot
of
them
the
elder
now
ha
begun
influencing
him
especially
since
he
tried
to
hang
himself
but
he
ll
come
and
tell
me
all
himself
you
think
he
ll
hold
out
wait
a
bit
he
ll
take
his
word
back
i
am
waiting
from
hour
to
hour
for
him
to
come
and
abjure
his
evidence
i
have
come
to
like
that
nikolay
and
am
studying
him
in
detail
and
what
do
you
think
he
answered
me
very
plausibly
on
some
point
he
obviously
had
collected
some
evidence
and
prepared
himself
cleverly
but
on
other
point
he
is
simply
at
sea
know
nothing
and
doesn
t
even
suspect
that
he
doesn
t
know
no
rodion
romanovitch
nikolay
doesn
t
come
in
this
is
a
fantastic
gloomy
business
a
modern
case
an
incident
of
when
the
heart
of
man
is
troubled
when
the
phrase
is
quoted
that
blood
renews
when
comfort
is
preached
a
the
aim
of
life
here
we
have
bookish
dream
a
heart
unhinged
by
theory
here
we
see
resolution
in
the
first
stage
but
resolution
of
a
special
kind
he
resolved
to
do
it
like
jumping
over
a
precipice
or
from
a
bell
tower
and
his
leg
shook
a
he
went
to
the
crime
he
forgot
to
shut
the
door
after
him
and
murdered
two
people
for
a
theory
he
committed
the
murder
and
couldn
t
take
the
money
and
what
he
did
manage
to
snatch
up
he
hid
under
a
stone
it
wasn
t
enough
for
him
to
suffer
agony
behind
the
door
while
they
battered
at
the
door
and
rung
the
bell
no
he
had
to
go
to
the
empty
lodging
half
delirious
to
recall
the
he
wanted
to
feel
the
cold
shiver
over
again
well
that
we
grant
wa
through
illness
but
consider
this
he
is
a
murderer
but
look
upon
himself
a
an
honest
man
despises
others
pose
a
injured
innocence
no
that
s
not
the
work
of
a
nikolay
my
dear
rodion
romanovitch
all
that
had
been
said
before
had
sounded
so
like
a
recantation
that
these
word
were
too
great
a
shock
raskolnikov
shuddered
a
though
he
had
been
stabbed
then
who
then
is
the
murderer
he
asked
in
a
breathless
voice
unable
to
restrain
himself
porfiry
petrovitch
sank
back
in
his
chair
a
though
he
were
amazed
at
the
question
who
is
the
murderer
he
repeated
a
though
unable
to
believe
his
ear
why
rodion
romanovitch
you
are
the
murderer
he
added
almost
in
a
whisper
in
a
voice
of
genuine
conviction
raskolnikov
leapt
from
the
sofa
stood
up
for
a
few
second
and
sat
down
again
without
uttering
a
word
his
face
twitched
convulsively
your
lip
is
twitching
just
a
it
did
before
porfiry
petrovitch
observed
almost
sympathetically
you
ve
been
misunderstanding
me
i
think
rodion
romanovitch
he
added
after
a
brief
pause
that
s
why
you
are
so
surprised
i
came
on
purpose
to
tell
you
everything
and
deal
openly
with
it
wa
not
i
murdered
her
raskolnikov
whispered
like
a
frightened
child
caught
in
the
act
no
it
wa
you
you
rodion
romanovitch
and
no
one
else
porfiry
whispered
sternly
with
conviction
they
were
both
silent
and
the
silence
lasted
strangely
long
about
ten
minute
raskolnikov
put
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
passed
his
finger
through
his
hair
porfiry
petrovitch
sat
quietly
waiting
suddenly
raskolnikov
looked
scornfully
at
porfiry
you
are
at
your
old
trick
again
porfiry
petrovitch
your
old
method
again
i
wonder
you
don
t
get
sick
of
it
oh
stop
that
what
doe
that
matter
now
it
would
be
a
different
matter
if
there
were
witness
present
but
we
are
whispering
alone
you
see
yourself
that
i
have
not
come
to
chase
and
capture
you
like
a
hare
whether
you
confess
it
or
not
is
nothing
to
me
now
for
myself
i
am
convinced
without
if
so
what
did
you
come
for
raskolnikov
asked
irritably
i
ask
you
the
same
question
again
if
you
consider
me
guilty
why
don
t
you
take
me
to
prison
oh
that
s
your
question
i
will
answer
you
point
for
point
in
the
first
place
to
arrest
you
so
directly
is
not
to
my
how
so
if
you
are
convinced
you
ought
ach
what
if
i
am
convinced
that
s
only
my
dream
for
the
time
why
should
i
put
you
in
safety
you
know
that
s
it
since
you
ask
me
to
do
it
if
i
confront
you
with
that
workman
for
instance
and
you
say
to
him
were
you
drunk
or
not
who
saw
me
with
you
i
simply
took
you
to
be
drunk
and
you
were
drunk
well
what
could
i
answer
especially
a
your
story
is
a
more
likely
one
than
his
for
there
s
nothing
but
psychology
to
support
his
evidence
that
s
almost
unseemly
with
his
ugly
mug
while
you
hit
the
mark
exactly
for
the
rascal
is
an
inveterate
drunkard
and
notoriously
so
and
i
have
myself
admitted
candidly
several
time
already
that
that
psychology
can
be
taken
in
two
way
and
that
the
second
way
is
stronger
and
look
far
more
probable
and
that
apart
from
that
i
have
a
yet
nothing
against
you
and
though
i
shall
put
you
in
prison
and
indeed
have
come
quite
contrary
to
etiquette
to
inform
you
of
it
beforehand
yet
i
tell
you
frankly
also
contrary
to
etiquette
that
it
won
t
be
to
my
advantage
well
secondly
i
ve
come
to
you
because
yes
yes
secondly
raskolnikov
wa
listening
breathless
because
a
i
told
you
just
now
i
consider
i
owe
you
an
explanation
i
don
t
want
you
to
look
upon
me
a
a
monster
a
i
have
a
genuine
liking
for
you
you
may
believe
me
or
not
and
in
the
third
place
i
ve
come
to
you
with
a
direct
and
open
proposition
that
you
should
surrender
and
confess
it
will
be
infinitely
more
to
your
advantage
and
to
my
advantage
too
for
my
task
will
be
done
well
is
this
open
on
my
part
or
not
raskolnikov
thought
a
minute
listen
porfiry
petrovitch
you
said
just
now
you
have
nothing
but
psychology
to
go
on
yet
now
you
ve
gone
on
mathematics
well
what
if
you
are
mistaken
yourself
now
no
rodion
romanovitch
i
am
not
mistaken
i
have
a
little
fact
even
then
providence
sent
it
what
little
fact
i
won
t
tell
you
what
rodion
romanovitch
and
in
any
case
i
haven
t
the
right
to
put
it
off
any
longer
i
must
arrest
you
so
think
it
over
it
make
no
difference
to
me
and
so
i
speak
only
for
your
sake
believe
me
it
will
be
better
rodion
raskolnikov
smiled
malignantly
that
s
not
simply
ridiculous
it
s
positively
shameless
why
even
if
i
were
guilty
which
i
don
t
admit
what
reason
should
i
have
to
confess
when
you
tell
me
yourself
that
i
shall
be
in
greater
safety
in
prison
ah
rodion
romanovitch
don
t
put
too
much
faith
in
word
perhaps
prison
will
not
be
altogether
a
restful
place
that
s
only
theory
and
my
theory
and
what
authority
am
i
for
you
perhaps
too
even
now
i
am
hiding
something
from
you
i
can
t
lay
bare
everything
and
how
can
you
ask
what
advantage
don
t
you
know
how
it
would
lessen
your
sentence
you
would
be
confessing
at
a
moment
when
another
man
ha
taken
the
crime
on
himself
and
so
ha
muddled
the
whole
case
consider
that
i
swear
before
god
that
i
will
so
arrange
that
your
confession
shall
come
a
a
complete
surprise
we
will
make
a
clean
sweep
of
all
these
psychological
point
of
a
suspicion
against
you
so
that
your
crime
will
appear
to
have
been
something
like
an
aberration
for
in
truth
it
wa
an
aberration
i
am
an
honest
man
rodion
romanovitch
and
will
keep
my
raskolnikov
maintained
a
mournful
silence
and
let
his
head
sink
dejectedly
he
pondered
a
long
while
and
at
last
smiled
again
but
his
smile
wa
sad
and
gentle
no
he
said
apparently
abandoning
all
attempt
to
keep
up
appearance
with
porfiry
it
s
not
worth
it
i
don
t
care
about
lessening
the
sentence
that
s
just
what
i
wa
afraid
of
porfiry

why

it
the
bourgeois
disgrace
you
are
afraid

it
may
be
that
you
are
afraid
of
it
without
knowing
it
because
you
are

shouldn

whispered
with
loathing
and
contempt
a
though
he
did
not
want
to
speak
aloud
he
got
up
again
a
though
he
meant
to
go
away
but
sat
down
again
in
evident
despair
hang

if
you
like
you
ve
lost
faith
and
you
think
that
i
am
grossly
flattering
you
but
how
long
ha
your
life
been
how
much
do
you
understand
you
made
up
a
theory
and
then
were
ashamed
that
it
broke
down
and
turned
out
to
be
not
at
all
original
it
turned
out
something
base
that
s
true
but
you
are
not
hopelessly
base
by
no
mean
so
base
at
least
you
didn
t
deceive
yourself
for
long
you
went
straight
to
the
furthest
point
at
one
bound
how
do
i
regard
you
i
regard
you
a
one
of
those
men
who
would
stand
and
smile
at
their
torturer
while
he
cut
their
entrails
out
if
only
they
have
found
faith

god
find
it
and
you
will
live
you
have
long
needed
a
change
of
air
suffering
too
is
a
good
thing
suffer
maybe
nikolay
is
right
in
wanting
to
suffer
i
know
you
don
t
believe
in
it
but
don
t
be

yourself
straight
into

don

afraid
the
flood
will
bear
you
to
the
bank
and
set
you
safe
on
your
foot
again
what
bank
how
can
i
tell
i
only
believe
that
you
have
long

i
know
that
you
take
all
my
word
now
for
a
set
speech
prepared
beforehand

maybe
you
will
remember
them
after
they
may
be
of
use
some
time
that
s
why
i
speak
it
s
a
well
that
you
only
killed
the
old
woman
if
you
d
invented
another
theory
you
might
perhaps
have
done
something
a
thousand
time
more
hideous
you
ought
to
thank
god
perhaps
how
do
you
know
perhaps
god
is
saving
you
for
something
but
keep
a
good
heart
and
have
less
fear
are
you
afraid
of
the
great
expiation
before
you
no
it
would
be
shameful
to
be
afraid
of
it
since
you
have
taken
such
a
step
you
must
harden
your
heart
there
is
justice
in
it
you
must
fulfil
the
demand
of
justice
i
know
that
you
don

indeed
life
will
bring
you
through
you
will

down

you
need
now

who
are
you
what

are
you
from
the
height
of
what
majestic
calm
do
you
proclaim

who
am
i
i
am
a
man
with
nothing
to

that
s
all
a
man
perhaps
of
feeling
and
sympathy
maybe
of
some
knowledge
too
but
my
day
is
over
but
you
are
a
different
matter
there
is
life
waiting
for
you
though
who

maybe
your
life
too
will
pas
off
in

come
to
nothing
come

that
you

you

perhaps
no

will
see
you

so

why
are
you
smiling
again
at
my
being
such
a
schiller
i
bet
you
re
imagining
that
i
am
trying
to
get
round
you
by
flattery
well
perhaps
i
am
perhaps
you
d
better
not
believe
my
word
perhaps
you
d
better
never
believe
it
altogether
i
m
made
that
way
i
confess
it
but
let
me
add
you
can
judge
for
yourself
i
think
how
far
i
am
a
base
sort
of
man
and
how
far
i
am
when
do
you
mean
to
arrest
me
well
i
can
let
you
walk
about
another
day
or
two
think
it
over
my
dear
fellow
and
pray
to
god
it
s
more
in
your
interest
believe
and
what
if
i
run
away
asked
raskolnikov
with
a
strange
smile
no
you
won
t
run
away
a
peasant
would
run
away
a
fashionable
dissenter
would
run
away
the
flunkey
of
another
man
s
thought
for
you
ve
only
to
show
him
the
end
of
your
little
finger
and
he
ll
be
ready
to
believe
in
anything
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
you
ve
ceased
to
believe
in
your
theory
already
what
will
you
run
away
with
and
what
would
you
do
in
hiding
it
would
be
hateful
and
difficult
for
you
and
what
you
need
more
than
anything
in
life
is
a
definite
position
an
atmosphere
to
suit
you
and
what
sort
of
atmosphere
would
you
have
if
you
ran
away
you
d
come
back
of
yourself

t
get
on
without
and
if
i
put
you
in
prison
say
you
ve
been
there
a
month
or
two
or
three
remember
my
word
you
ll
confess
of
yourself
and
perhaps
to
your
own
surprise
you
won
t
know
an
hour
beforehand
that
you
are
coming
with
a
confession
i

convinced

you

you

insistence
you
re
a
strange
man

you

you
won

walk

far
if
anything
happens
i
have
one
request
to
make
of
you
he
added
dropping
his
voice
it
s
an
awkward
one
but
important
if
anything
were
to
happen
though
indeed
i
don
t
believe
in
it
and
think
you
quite
incapable
of
it
yet
in
case
you
were
taken
during
these
forty
or
fifty
hour
with
the
notion
of
putting
an
end
to
the
business
in
some
other
way
in
some
fantastic
fashion
laying
hand
on
yourself
it
s
an
absurd
proposition
but
you
must
forgive
me
for
it
do
leave
a
brief
but
precise
note
only
two
line
and
mention
the
stone

will
be
more
generous

till
we

and

you
porfiry
went
out
stooping
and
avoiding
looking
at
raskolnikov
the
latter
went
to
the
window
and
waited
with
irritable
impatience
till
he
calculated
that
porfiry
had
reached
the
street
and
moved
away
then
he
too
went
hurriedly
out
of
the
room
chapter
iii
he
hurried
to
svidrigaïlov
s
what
he
had
to
hope
from
that
man
he
did
not
know
but
that
man
had
some
hidden
power
over
him
having
once
recognised
this
he
could
not
rest
and
now
the
time
had
come
on
the
way
one
question
particularly
worried
him
had
svidrigaïlov
been
to
porfiry
s
a
far
a
he
could
judge
he
would
swear
to
it
that
he
had
not
he
pondered
again
and
again
went
over
porfiry
s
visit
no
he
hadn
t
been
of
course
he
hadn
t
but
if
he
had
not
been
yet
would
he
go
meanwhile
for
the
present
he
fancied
he
couldn
t
why
he
could
not
have
explained
but
if
he
could
he
would
not
have
wasted
much
thought
over
it
at
the
moment
it
all
worried
him
and
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
attend
to
it
strange
to
say
none
would
have
believed
it
perhaps
but
he
only
felt
a
faint
vague
anxiety
about
his
immediate
future
another
much
more
important
anxiety
tormented
him
it
concerned
himself
but
in
a
different
more
vital
way
moreover
he
wa
conscious
of
immense
moral
fatigue
though
his
mind
wa
working
better
that
morning
than
it
had
done
of
late
and
wa
it
worth
while
after
all
that
had
happened
to
contend
with
these
new
trivial
difficulty
wa
it
worth
while
for
instance
to
manoeuvre
that
svidrigaïlov
should
not
go
to
porfiry
s
wa
it
worth
while
to
investigate
to
ascertain
the
fact
to
waste
time
over
anyone
like
svidrigaïlov
oh
how
sick
he
wa
of
it
all
and
yet
he
wa
hastening
to
svidrigaïlov
could
he
be
expecting
something
from
him
information
or
mean
of
escape
men
will
catch
at
straw
wa
it
destiny
or
some
instinct
bringing
them
together
perhaps
it
wa
only
fatigue
despair
perhaps
it
wa
not
svidrigaïlov
but
some
other
whom
he
needed
and
svidrigaïlov
had
simply
presented
himself
by
chance
sonia
but
what
should
he
go
to
sonia
for
now
to
beg
her
tear
again
he
wa
afraid
of
sonia
too
sonia
stood
before
him
a
an
irrevocable
sentence
he
must
go
his
own
way
or
hers
at
that
moment
especially
he
did
not
feel
equal
to
seeing
her
no
would
it
not
be
better
to
try
svidrigaïlov
and
he
could
not
help
inwardly
owning
that
he
had
long
felt
that
he
must
see
him
for
some
reason
but
what
could
they
have
in
common
their
very
could
not
be
of
the
same
kind
the
man
moreover
wa
very
unpleasant
evidently
depraved
undoubtedly
cunning
and
deceitful
possibly
malignant
such
story
were
told
about
him
it
is
true
he
wa
befriending
katerina
ivanovna
s
child
but
who
could
tell
with
what
motive
and
what
it
meant
the
man
always
had
some
design
some
project
there
wa
another
thought
which
had
been
continually
hovering
of
late
about
raskolnikov
s
mind
and
causing
him
great
uneasiness
it
wa
so
painful
that
he
made
distinct
effort
to
get
rid
of
it
he
sometimes
thought
that
svidrigaïlov
wa
dogging
his
footstep
svidrigaïlov
had
found
out
his
secret
and
had
had
design
on
dounia
what
if
he
had
them
still
wasn
t
it
practically
certain
that
he
had
and
what
if
having
learnt
his
secret
and
so
having
gained
power
over
him
he
were
to
use
it
a
a
weapon
against
dounia
this
idea
sometimes
even
tormented
his
dream
but
it
had
never
presented
itself
so
vividly
to
him
a
on
his
way
to
svidrigaïlov
the
very
thought
moved
him
to
gloomy
rage
to
begin
with
this
would
transform
everything
even
his
own
position
he
would
have
at
once
to
confess
his
secret
to
dounia
would
he
have
to
give
himself
up
perhaps
to
prevent
dounia
from
taking
some
rash
step
the
letter
this
morning
dounia
had
received
a
letter
from
whom
could
she
get
letter
in
petersburg
luzhin
perhaps
it
s
true
razumihin
wa
there
to
protect
her
but
razumihin
knew
nothing
of
the
position
perhaps
it
wa
his
duty
to
tell
razumihin
he
thought
of
it
with
repugnance
in
any
case
he
must
see
svidrigaïlov
a
soon
a
possible
he
decided
finally
thank
god
the
detail
of
the
interview
were
of
little
consequence
if
only
he
could
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
but
if
svidrigaïlov
were
capable
if
he
were
intriguing
against
dounia
then
raskolnikov
wa
so
exhausted
by
what
he
had
passed
through
that
month
that
he
could
only
decide
such
question
in
one
way
then
i
shall
kill
him
he
thought
in
cold
despair
a
sudden
anguish
oppressed
his
heart
he
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
began
looking
about
to
see
where
he
wa
and
which
way
he
wa
going
he
found
himself
in
x
prospect
thirty
or
forty
pace
from
the
hay
market
through
which
he
had
come
the
whole
second
storey
of
the
house
on
the
left
wa
used
a
a
tavern
all
the
window
were
wide
open
judging
from
the
figure
moving
at
the
window
the
room
were
full
to
overflowing
there
were
sound
of
singing
of
clarionet
and
violin
and
the
boom
of
a
turkish
drum
he
could
hear
woman
shrieking
he
wa
about
to
turn
back
wondering
why
he
had
come
to
the
x
prospect
when
suddenly
at
one
of
the
end
window
he
saw
svidrigaïlov
sitting
at
a
right
in
the
open
window
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
raskolnikov
wa
dreadfully
taken
aback
almost
terrified
svidrigaïlov
wa
silently
watching
and
scrutinising
him
and
what
struck
raskolnikov
at
once
seemed
to
be
meaning
to
get
up
and
slip
away
unobserved
raskolnikov
at
once
pretended
not
to
have
seen
him
but
to
be
looking
away
while
he
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
his
heart
wa
beating
violently
yet
it
wa
evident
that
svidrigaïlov
did
not
want
to
be
seen
he
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
wa
on
the
point
of
concealing
himself
but
a
he
got
up
and
moved
back
his
chair
he
seemed
to
have
become
suddenly
aware
that
raskolnikov
had
seen
him
and
wa
watching
him
what
had
passed
between
them
wa
much
the
same
a
what
happened
at
their
first
meeting
in
raskolnikov
s
room
a
sly
smile
came
into
svidrigaïlov
s
face
and
grew
broader
and
broader
each
knew
that
he
wa
seen
and
watched
by
the
other
at
last
svidrigaïlov
broke
into
a
loud
laugh
well
well
come
in
if
you
want
me
i
am
here
he
shouted
from
the
window
raskolnikov
went
up
into
the
tavern
he
found
svidrigaïlov
in
a
tiny
back
room
adjoining
the
saloon
in
which
merchant
clerk
and
number
of
people
of
all
sort
were
drinking
tea
at
twenty
little
table
to
the
desperate
bawling
of
a
chorus
of
singer
the
click
of
billiard
ball
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
on
the
table
before
svidrigaïlov
stood
an
open
bottle
and
a
glass
half
full
of
champagne
in
the
room
he
found
also
a
boy
with
a
little
hand
organ
a
girl
of
eighteen
wearing
a
striped
skirt
and
a
tyrolese
hat
with
ribbon
in
spite
of
the
chorus
in
the
other
room
she
wa
singing
some
servant
hall
song
in
a
rather
husky
contralto
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
organ
come
that
s
enough
svidrigaïlov
stopped
her
at
raskolnikov
s
entrance
the
girl
at
once
broke
off
and
stood
waiting
respectfully
she
had
sung
her
guttural
rhyme
too
with
a
serious
and
respectful
expression
in
her
face
hey
philip
a
glass
shouted
svidrigaïlov
i
won
t
drink
anything
said
raskolnikov
a
you
like
i
didn
t
mean
it
for
you
drink
katia
i
don
t
want
anything
more
you
can
he
poured
her
out
a
full
glass
and
laid
down
a
yellow
note
katia
drank
off
her
glass
of
wine
a
woman
do
without
putting
it
down
in
twenty
gulp
took
the
note
and
kissed
svidrigaïlov
s
hand
which
he
allowed
quite
seriously
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
the
boy
trailed
after
her
with
the
organ
both
had
been
brought
in
from
the
street
svidrigaïlov
had
not
been
a
week
in
petersburg
but
everything
about
him
wa
already
so
to
speak
on
a
patriarchal
footing
the
waiter
philip
wa
by
now
an
old
friend
and
very
obsequious
the
door
leading
to
the
saloon
had
a
lock
on
it
svidrigaïlov
wa
at
home
in
this
room
and
perhaps
spent
whole
day
in
it
the
tavern
wa
dirty
and
wretched
not
even
i
wa
going
to
see
you
and
looking
for
you
raskolnikov
began
but
i
don
t
know
what
made
me
turn
from
the
hay
market
into
the
x
prospect
just
now
i
never
take
this
turning
i
turn
to
the
right
from
the
hay
market
and
this
isn
t
the
way
to
you
i
simply
turned
and
here
you
are
it
is
strange
why
don
t
you
say
at
once
it
s
a
miracle
because
it
may
be
only
oh
that
s
the
way
with
all
you
folk
laughed
svidrigaïlov
you
won
t
admit
it
even
if
you
do
inwardly
believe
it
a
miracle
here
you
say
that
it
may
be
only
chance
and
what
coward
they
all
are
here
about
having
an
opinion
of
their
own
you
can
t
fancy
rodion
romanovitch
i
don
t
mean
you
you
have
an
opinion
of
your
own
and
are
not
afraid
to
have
it
that
s
how
it
wa
you
attracted
my
nothing
else
well
that
s
enough
you
know
svidrigaïlov
wa
obviously
exhilarated
but
only
slightly
so
he
had
not
had
more
than
half
a
glass
of
wine
i
fancy
you
came
to
see
me
before
you
knew
that
i
wa
capable
of
having
what
you
call
an
opinion
of
my
own
observed
raskolnikov
oh
well
it
wa
a
different
matter
everyone
ha
his
own
plan
and
apropos
of
the
miracle
let
me
tell
you
that
i
think
you
have
been
asleep
for
the
last
two
or
three
day
i
told
you
of
this
tavern
myself
there
is
no
miracle
in
your
coming
straight
here
i
explained
the
way
myself
told
you
where
it
wa
and
the
hour
you
could
find
me
here
do
you
remember
i
don
t
remember
answered
raskolnikov
with
surprise
i
believe
you
i
told
you
twice
the
address
ha
been
stamped
mechanically
on
your
memory
you
turned
this
way
mechanically
and
yet
precisely
according
to
the
direction
though
you
are
not
aware
of
it
when
i
told
you
then
i
hardly
hoped
you
understood
me
you
give
yourself
away
too
much
rodion
romanovitch
and
another
thing
i
m
convinced
there
are
lot
of
people
in
petersburg
who
talk
to
themselves
a
they
walk
this
is
a
town
of
crazy
people
if
only
we
had
scientific
men
doctor
lawyer
and
philosopher
might
make
most
valuable
investigation
in
petersburg
each
in
his
own
line
there
are
few
place
where
there
are
so
many
gloomy
strong
and
queer
influence
on
the
soul
of
man
a
in
petersburg
the
mere
influence
of
climate
mean
so
much
and
it
s
the
administrative
centre
of
all
russia
and
it
character
must
be
reflected
on
the
whole
country
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
now
the
point
is
that
i
have
several
time
watched
you
you
walk
out
of
your
house
holding
your
head
high
twenty
pace
from
home
you
let
it
sink
and
fold
your
hand
behind
your
back
you
look
and
evidently
see
nothing
before
nor
beside
you
at
last
you
begin
moving
your
lip
and
talking
to
yourself
and
sometimes
you
wave
one
hand
and
declaim
and
at
last
stand
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
that
s
not
at
all
the
thing
someone
may
be
watching
you
besides
me
and
it
won
t
do
you
any
good
it
s
nothing
really
to
do
with
me
and
i
can
t
cure
you
but
of
course
you
understand
do
you
know
that
i
am
being
followed
asked
raskolnikov
looking
inquisitively
at
him
no
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
svidrigaïlov
seeming
surprised
well
then
let
u
leave
me
alone
raskolnikov
muttered
frowning
very
good
let
u
leave
you
you
had
better
tell
me
if
you
come
here
to
drink
and
directed
me
twice
to
come
here
to
you
why
did
you
hide
and
try
to
get
away
just
now
when
i
looked
at
the
window
from
the
street
i
saw
and
why
wa
it
you
lay
on
your
sofa
with
closed
eye
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
though
you
were
wide
awake
while
i
stood
in
your
doorway
i
saw
i
may
have
had
reason
you
know
that
and
i
may
have
had
my
reason
though
you
don
t
know
raskolnikov
dropped
his
right
elbow
on
the
table
leaned
his
chin
in
the
finger
of
his
right
hand
and
stared
intently
at
svidrigaïlov
for
a
full
minute
he
scrutinised
his
face
which
had
impressed
him
before
it
wa
a
strange
face
like
a
mask
white
and
red
with
bright
red
lip
with
a
flaxen
beard
and
still
thick
flaxen
hair
his
eye
were
somehow
too
blue
and
their
expression
somehow
too
heavy
and
fixed
there
wa
something
awfully
unpleasant
in
that
handsome
face
which
looked
so
wonderfully
young
for
his
age
svidrigaïlov
wa
smartly
dressed
in
light
summer
clothes
and
wa
particularly
dainty
in
his
linen
he
wore
a
huge
ring
with
a
precious
stone
in
it
have
i
got
to
bother
myself
about
you
too
now
said
raskolnikov
suddenly
coming
with
nervous
impatience
straight
to
the
point
even
though
perhaps
you
are
the
most
dangerous
man
if
you
care
to
injure
me
i
don
t
want
to
put
myself
out
any
more
i
will
show
you
at
once
that
i
don
t
prize
myself
a
you
probably
think
i
do
i
ve
come
to
tell
you
at
once
that
if
you
keep
to
your
former
intention
with
regard
to
my
sister
and
if
you
think
to
derive
any
benefit
in
that
direction
from
what
ha
been
discovered
of
late
i
will
kill
you
before
you
get
me
locked
up
you
can
reckon
on
my
word
you
know
that
i
can
keep
it
and
in
the
second
place
if
you
want
to
tell
me
anything
for
i
keep
fancying
all
this
time
that
you
have
something
to
tell
me
make
haste
and
tell
it
for
time
is
precious
and
very
likely
it
will
soon
be
too
why
in
such
haste
asked
svidrigaïlov
looking
at
him
curiously
everyone
ha
his
plan
raskolnikov
answered
gloomily
and
impatiently
you
urged
me
yourself
to
frankness
just
now
and
at
the
first
question
you
refuse
to
answer
svidrigaïlov
observed
with
a
smile
you
keep
fancying
that
i
have
aim
of
my
own
and
so
you
look
at
me
with
suspicion
of
course
it
s
perfectly
natural
in
your
position
but
though
i
should
like
to
be
friend
with
you
i
shan
t
trouble
myself
to
convince
you
of
the
contrary
the
game
isn
t
worth
the
candle
and
i
wasn
t
intending
to
talk
to
you
about
anything
what
did
you
want
me
for
then
it
wa
you
who
came
hanging
about
why
simply
a
an
interesting
subject
for
observation
i
liked
the
fantastic
nature
of
your
position
that
s
what
it
wa
besides
you
are
the
brother
of
a
person
who
greatly
interested
me
and
from
that
person
i
had
in
the
past
heard
a
very
great
deal
about
you
from
which
i
gathered
that
you
had
a
great
influence
over
her
isn
t
that
enough
still
i
must
admit
that
your
question
is
rather
complex
and
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
here
you
for
instance
have
come
to
me
not
only
for
a
definite
object
but
for
the
sake
of
hearing
something
new
isn
t
that
so
isn
t
that
so
persisted
svidrigaïlov
with
a
sly
smile
well
can
t
you
fancy
then
that
i
too
on
my
way
here
in
the
train
wa
reckoning
on
you
on
your
telling
me
something
new
and
on
my
making
some
profit
out
of
you
you
see
what
rich
men
we
are
what
profit
could
you
make
how
can
i
tell
you
how
do
i
know
you
see
in
what
a
tavern
i
spend
all
my
time
and
it
s
my
enjoyment
that
s
to
say
it
s
no
great
enjoyment
but
one
must
sit
somewhere
that
poor
katia
now
you
saw
her
if
only
i
had
been
a
glutton
now
a
club
gourmand
but
you
see
i
can
eat
he
pointed
to
a
little
table
in
the
corner
where
the
remnant
of
a
and
potato
lay
on
a
tin
dish
have
you
dined
by
the
way
i
ve
had
something
and
want
nothing
more
i
don
t
drink
for
instance
at
all
except
for
champagne
i
never
touch
anything
and
not
more
than
a
glass
of
that
all
the
evening
and
even
that
is
enough
to
make
my
head
ache
i
ordered
it
just
now
to
wind
myself
up
for
i
am
just
going
off
somewhere
and
you
see
me
in
a
peculiar
state
of
mind
that
wa
why
i
hid
myself
just
now
like
a
schoolboy
for
i
wa
afraid
you
would
hinder
me
but
i
believe
he
pulled
out
his
watch
i
can
spend
an
hour
with
you
it
s
four
now
if
only
i
d
been
something
a
landowner
a
father
a
cavalry
officer
a
photographer
a
journalist
i
am
nothing
no
specialty
and
sometimes
i
am
positively
bored
i
really
thought
you
would
tell
me
something
but
what
are
you
and
why
have
you
come
here
what
am
i
you
know
a
gentleman
i
served
for
two
year
in
the
cavalry
then
i
knocked
about
here
in
petersburg
then
i
married
marfa
petrovna
and
lived
in
the
country
there
you
have
my
biography
you
are
a
gambler
i
believe
no
a
poor
sort
of
gambler
a
not
a
you
have
been
a
then
yes
i
ve
been
a
didn
t
you
get
thrashed
sometimes
it
did
happen
why
why
you
might
have
challenged
them
altogether
it
must
have
been
i
won
t
contradict
you
and
besides
i
am
no
hand
at
philosophy
i
confess
that
i
hastened
here
for
the
sake
of
the
a
soon
a
you
buried
marfa
petrovna
quite
so
svidrigaïlov
smiled
with
engaging
candour
what
of
it
you
seem
to
find
something
wrong
in
my
speaking
like
that
about
woman
you
ask
whether
i
find
anything
wrong
in
vice
vice
oh
that
s
what
you
are
after
but
i
ll
answer
you
in
order
first
about
woman
in
general
you
know
i
am
fond
of
talking
tell
me
what
should
i
restrain
myself
for
why
should
i
give
up
woman
since
i
have
a
passion
for
them
it
s
an
occupation
so
you
hope
for
nothing
here
but
vice
oh
very
well
for
vice
then
you
insist
on
it
being
vice
but
anyway
i
like
a
direct
question
in
this
vice
at
least
there
is
something
permanent
founded
indeed
upon
nature
and
not
dependent
on
fantasy
something
present
in
the
blood
like
an
ember
for
ever
setting
one
on
fire
and
maybe
not
to
be
quickly
extinguished
even
with
year
you
ll
agree
it
s
an
occupation
of
a
that
s
nothing
to
rejoice
at
it
s
a
disease
and
a
dangerous
oh
that
s
what
you
think
is
it
i
agree
that
it
is
a
disease
like
everything
that
exceeds
moderation
and
of
course
in
this
one
must
exceed
moderation
but
in
the
first
place
everybody
doe
so
in
one
way
or
another
and
in
the
second
place
of
course
one
ought
to
be
moderate
and
prudent
however
mean
it
may
be
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
i
hadn
t
this
i
might
have
to
shoot
myself
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
a
decent
man
ought
to
put
up
with
being
bored
but
yet
and
could
you
shoot
yourself
oh
come
svidrigaïlov
parried
with
disgust
please
don
t
speak
of
it
he
added
hurriedly
and
with
none
of
the
bragging
tone
he
had
shown
in
all
the
previous
conversation
his
face
quite
changed
i
admit
it
s
an
unpardonable
weakness
but
i
can
t
help
it
i
am
afraid
of
death
and
i
dislike
it
being
talked
of
do
you
know
that
i
am
to
a
certain
extent
a
mystic
ah
the
apparition
of
marfa
petrovna
do
they
still
go
on
visiting
you
oh
don
t
talk
of
them
there
have
been
no
more
in
petersburg
confound
them
he
cried
with
an
air
of
irritation
let
s
rather
talk
of
that
though
h
m
i
have
not
much
time
and
can
t
stay
long
with
you
it
s
a
pity
i
should
have
found
plenty
to
tell
what
s
your
engagement
a
woman
yes
a
woman
a
casual
incident
no
that
s
not
what
i
want
to
talk
and
the
hideousness
the
filthiness
of
all
your
surroundings
doesn
t
that
affect
you
have
you
lost
the
strength
to
stop
yourself
and
do
you
pretend
to
strength
too
you
surprised
me
just
now
rodion
romanovitch
though
i
knew
beforehand
it
would
be
so
you
preach
to
me
about
vice
and
æsthetics
you
a
schiller
you
an
idealist
of
course
that
s
all
a
it
should
be
and
it
would
be
surprising
if
it
were
not
so
yet
it
is
strange
in
reality
ah
what
a
pity
i
have
no
time
for
you
re
a
most
interesting
type
and
are
you
fond
of
schiller
i
am
awfully
fond
of
but
what
a
braggart
you
are
raskolnikov
said
with
some
disgust
upon
my
word
i
am
not
answered
svidrigaïlov
laughing
however
i
won
t
dispute
it
let
me
be
a
braggart
why
not
brag
if
it
hurt
no
one
i
spent
seven
year
in
the
country
with
marfa
petrovna
so
now
when
i
come
across
an
intelligent
person
like
you
intelligent
and
highly
interesting
i
am
simply
glad
to
talk
and
besides
i
ve
drunk
that
of
champagne
and
it
s
gone
to
my
head
a
little
and
besides
there
s
a
certain
fact
that
ha
wound
me
up
tremendously
but
about
that
i
will
keep
quiet
where
are
you
off
to
he
asked
in
alarm
raskolnikov
had
begun
getting
up
he
felt
oppressed
and
stifled
and
a
it
were
ill
at
ease
at
having
come
here
he
felt
convinced
that
svidrigaïlov
wa
the
most
worthless
scoundrel
on
the
face
of
the
earth
sit
down
stay
a
little
svidrigaïlov
begged
let
them
bring
you
some
tea
anyway
stay
a
little
i
won
t
talk
nonsense
about
myself
i
mean
i
ll
tell
you
something
if
you
like
i
ll
tell
you
how
a
woman
tried
to
save
me
a
you
would
call
it
it
will
be
an
answer
to
your
first
question
indeed
for
the
woman
wa
your
sister
may
i
tell
you
it
will
help
to
spend
the
tell
me
but
i
trust
that
you
oh
don
t
be
uneasy
besides
even
in
a
worthless
low
fellow
like
me
avdotya
romanovna
can
only
excite
the
deepest
chapter
iv
you
know
perhaps
yes
i
told
you
myself
began
svidrigaïlov
that
i
wa
in
the
debtor
prison
here
for
an
immense
sum
and
had
not
any
expectation
of
being
able
to
pay
it
there
s
no
need
to
go
into
particular
how
marfa
petrovna
bought
me
out
do
you
know
to
what
a
point
of
insanity
a
woman
can
sometimes
love
she
wa
an
honest
woman
and
very
sensible
although
completely
uneducated
would
you
believe
that
this
honest
and
jealous
woman
after
many
scene
of
hysteric
and
reproach
condescended
to
enter
into
a
kind
of
contract
with
me
which
she
kept
throughout
our
married
life
she
wa
considerably
older
than
i
and
besides
she
always
kept
a
clove
or
something
in
her
mouth
there
wa
so
much
swinishness
in
my
soul
and
honesty
too
of
a
sort
a
to
tell
her
straight
out
that
i
couldn
t
be
absolutely
faithful
to
her
this
confession
drove
her
to
frenzy
but
yet
she
seems
in
a
way
to
have
liked
my
brutal
frankness
she
thought
it
showed
i
wa
unwilling
to
deceive
her
if
i
warned
her
like
this
beforehand
and
for
a
jealous
woman
you
know
that
s
the
first
consideration
after
many
tear
an
unwritten
contract
wa
drawn
up
between
u
first
that
i
would
never
leave
marfa
petrovna
and
would
always
be
her
husband
secondly
that
i
would
never
absent
myself
without
her
permission
thirdly
that
i
would
never
set
up
a
permanent
mistress
fourthly
in
return
for
this
marfa
petrovna
gave
me
a
free
hand
with
the
maidservant
but
only
with
her
secret
knowledge
fifthly
god
forbid
my
falling
in
love
with
a
woman
of
our
class
sixthly
in
case
i
which
god
forbid
should
be
visited
by
a
great
serious
passion
i
wa
bound
to
reveal
it
to
marfa
petrovna
on
this
last
score
however
marfa
petrovna
wa
fairly
at
ease
she
wa
a
sensible
woman
and
so
she
could
not
help
looking
upon
me
a
a
dissolute
profligate
incapable
of
real
love
but
a
sensible
woman
and
a
jealous
woman
are
two
very
different
thing
and
that
s
where
the
trouble
came
in
but
to
judge
some
people
impartially
we
must
renounce
certain
preconceived
opinion
and
our
habitual
attitude
to
the
ordinary
people
about
u
i
have
reason
to
have
faith
in
your
judgment
rather
than
in
anyone
s
perhaps
you
have
already
heard
a
great
deal
that
wa
ridiculous
and
absurd
about
marfa
petrovna
she
certainly
had
some
very
ridiculous
way
but
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
feel
really
sorry
for
the
innumerable
woe
of
which
i
wa
the
cause
well
and
that
s
enough
i
think
by
way
of
a
decorous
for
the
most
tender
wife
of
a
most
tender
husband
when
we
quarrelled
i
usually
held
my
tongue
and
did
not
irritate
her
and
that
gentlemanly
conduct
rarely
failed
to
attain
it
object
it
influenced
her
it
pleased
her
indeed
these
were
time
when
she
wa
positively
proud
of
me
but
your
sister
she
couldn
t
put
up
with
anyway
and
however
she
came
to
risk
taking
such
a
beautiful
creature
into
her
house
a
a
governess
my
explanation
is
that
marfa
petrovna
wa
an
ardent
and
impressionable
woman
and
simply
fell
in
love
herself
literally
fell
in
love
with
your
sister
well
little
wonder
look
at
avdotya
romanovna
i
saw
the
danger
at
the
first
glance
and
what
do
you
think
i
resolved
not
to
look
at
her
even
but
avdotya
romanovna
herself
made
the
first
step
would
you
believe
it
would
you
believe
it
too
that
marfa
petrovna
wa
positively
angry
with
me
at
first
for
my
persistent
silence
about
your
sister
for
my
careless
reception
of
her
continual
adoring
praise
of
avdotya
romanovna
i
don
t
know
what
it
wa
she
wanted
well
of
course
marfa
petrovna
told
avdotya
romanovna
every
detail
about
me
she
had
the
unfortunate
habit
of
telling
literally
everyone
all
our
family
secret
and
continually
complaining
of
me
how
could
she
fail
to
confide
in
such
a
delightful
new
friend
i
expect
they
talked
of
nothing
else
but
me
and
no
doubt
avdotya
romanovna
heard
all
those
dark
mysterious
rumour
that
were
current
about
me
i
don
t
mind
betting
that
you
too
have
heard
something
of
the
sort
already
i
have
luzhin
charged
you
with
having
caused
the
death
of
a
child
is
that
true
don
t
refer
to
those
vulgar
tale
i
beg
said
svidrigaïlov
with
disgust
and
annoyance
if
you
insist
on
wanting
to
know
about
all
that
idiocy
i
will
tell
you
one
day
but
now
i
wa
told
too
about
some
footman
of
yours
in
the
country
whom
you
treated
i
beg
you
to
drop
the
subject
svidrigaïlov
interrupted
again
with
obvious
impatience
wa
that
the
footman
who
came
to
you
after
death
to
fill
your
pipe
you
told
me
about
it
raskolnikov
felt
more
and
more
irritated
svidrigaïlov
looked
at
him
attentively
and
raskolnikov
fancied
he
caught
a
flash
of
spiteful
mockery
in
that
look
but
svidrigaïlov
restrained
himself
and
answered
very
civilly
yes
it
wa
i
see
that
you
too
are
extremely
interested
and
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
at
the
first
opportunity
upon
my
soul
i
see
that
i
really
might
pas
for
a
romantic
figure
with
some
people
judge
how
grateful
i
must
be
to
marfa
petrovna
for
having
repeated
to
avdotya
romanovna
such
mysterious
and
interesting
gossip
about
me
i
dare
not
guess
what
impression
it
made
on
her
but
in
any
case
it
worked
in
my
interest
with
all
avdotya
romanovna
s
natural
aversion
and
in
spite
of
my
invariably
gloomy
and
repellent
aspect
she
did
at
least
feel
pity
for
me
pity
for
a
lost
soul
and
if
once
a
girl
s
heart
is
moved
to
it
s
more
dangerous
than
anything
she
is
bound
to
want
to
save
him
to
bring
him
to
his
sens
and
lift
him
up
and
draw
him
to
nobler
aim
and
restore
him
to
new
life
and
usefulness
well
we
all
know
how
far
such
dream
can
go
i
saw
at
once
that
the
bird
wa
flying
into
the
cage
of
herself
and
i
too
made
ready
i
think
you
are
frowning
rodion
romanovitch
there
s
no
need
a
you
know
it
all
ended
in
smoke
hang
it
all
what
a
lot
i
am
drinking
do
you
know
i
always
from
the
very
beginning
regretted
that
it
wasn
t
your
sister
s
fate
to
be
born
in
the
second
or
third
century
a
the
daughter
of
a
reigning
prince
or
some
governor
or
in
asia
minor
she
would
undoubtedly
have
been
one
of
those
who
would
endure
martyrdom
and
would
have
smiled
when
they
branded
her
bosom
with
hot
pincer
and
she
would
have
gone
to
it
of
herself
and
in
the
fourth
or
fifth
century
she
would
have
walked
away
into
the
egyptian
desert
and
would
have
stayed
there
thirty
year
living
on
root
and
ecstasy
and
vision
she
is
simply
thirsting
to
face
some
torture
for
someone
and
if
she
can
t
get
her
torture
she
ll
throw
herself
out
of
a
window
i
ve
heard
something
of
a
razumihin
he
s
said
to
be
a
sensible
fellow
his
surname
suggests
it
indeed
he
s
probably
a
divinity
student
well
he
d
better
look
after
your
sister
i
believe
i
understand
her
and
i
am
proud
of
it
but
at
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
a
you
know
one
is
apt
to
be
more
heedless
and
stupid
one
doesn
t
see
clearly
hang
it
all
why
is
she
so
handsome
it
s
not
my
fault
in
fact
it
began
on
my
side
with
a
most
irresistible
physical
desire
avdotya
romanovna
is
awfully
chaste
incredibly
and
phenomenally
so
take
note
i
tell
you
this
about
your
sister
a
a
fact
she
is
almost
morbidly
chaste
in
spite
of
her
broad
intelligence
and
it
will
stand
in
her
way
there
happened
to
be
a
girl
in
the
house
then
parasha
a
wench
whom
i
had
never
seen
before
she
had
just
come
from
another
village
very
pretty
but
incredibly
stupid
she
burst
into
tear
wailed
so
that
she
could
be
heard
all
over
the
place
and
caused
scandal
one
day
after
dinner
avdotya
romanovna
followed
me
into
an
avenue
in
the
garden
and
with
flashing
eye
on
my
leaving
poor
parasha
alone
it
wa
almost
our
first
conversation
by
ourselves
i
of
course
wa
only
too
pleased
to
obey
her
wish
tried
to
appear
disconcerted
embarrassed
in
fact
played
my
part
not
badly
then
came
interview
mysterious
conversation
exhortation
entreaty
supplication
even
tear
would
you
believe
it
even
tear
think
what
the
passion
for
propaganda
will
bring
some
girl
to
i
of
course
threw
it
all
on
my
destiny
posed
a
hungering
and
thirsting
for
light
and
finally
resorted
to
the
most
powerful
weapon
in
the
subjection
of
the
female
heart
a
weapon
which
never
fails
one
it
s
the
resource
flattery
nothing
in
the
world
is
harder
than
speaking
the
truth
and
nothing
easier
than
flattery
if
there
s
the
hundredth
part
of
a
false
note
in
speaking
the
truth
it
lead
to
a
discord
and
that
lead
to
trouble
but
if
all
to
the
last
note
is
false
in
flattery
it
is
just
a
agreeable
and
is
heard
not
without
satisfaction
it
may
be
a
coarse
satisfaction
but
still
a
satisfaction
and
however
coarse
the
flattery
at
least
half
will
be
sure
to
seem
true
that
s
so
for
all
stage
of
development
and
class
of
society
a
vestal
virgin
might
be
seduced
by
flattery
i
can
never
remember
without
laughter
how
i
once
seduced
a
lady
who
wa
devoted
to
her
husband
her
child
and
her
principle
what
fun
it
wa
and
how
little
trouble
and
the
lady
really
had
principle
of
her
own
anyway
all
my
tactic
lay
in
simply
being
utterly
annihilated
and
prostrate
before
her
purity
i
flattered
her
shamelessly
and
a
soon
a
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
pressure
of
the
hand
even
a
glance
from
her
i
would
reproach
myself
for
having
snatched
it
by
force
and
would
declare
that
she
had
resisted
so
that
i
could
never
have
gained
anything
but
for
my
being
so
unprincipled
i
maintained
that
she
wa
so
innocent
that
she
could
not
foresee
my
treachery
and
yielded
to
me
unconsciously
unawares
and
so
on
in
fact
i
triumphed
while
my
lady
remained
firmly
convinced
that
she
wa
innocent
chaste
and
faithful
to
all
her
duty
and
obligation
and
had
succumbed
quite
by
accident
and
how
angry
she
wa
with
me
when
i
explained
to
her
at
last
that
it
wa
my
sincere
conviction
that
she
wa
just
a
eager
a
i
poor
marfa
petrovna
wa
awfully
weak
on
the
side
of
flattery
and
if
i
had
only
cared
to
i
might
have
had
all
her
property
settled
on
me
during
her
lifetime
i
am
drinking
an
awful
lot
of
wine
now
and
talking
too
much
i
hope
you
won
t
be
angry
if
i
mention
now
that
i
wa
beginning
to
produce
the
same
effect
on
avdotya
romanovna
but
i
wa
stupid
and
impatient
and
spoiled
it
all
avdotya
romanovna
had
several
time
and
one
time
in
particular
been
greatly
displeased
by
the
expression
of
my
eye
would
you
believe
it
there
wa
sometimes
a
light
in
them
which
frightened
her
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
more
unguarded
till
it
wa
hateful
to
her
no
need
to
go
into
detail
but
we
parted
there
i
acted
stupidly
again
i
fell
to
jeering
in
the
coarsest
way
at
all
such
propaganda
and
effort
to
convert
me
parasha
came
on
to
the
scene
again
and
not
she
alone
in
fact
there
wa
a
tremendous
ah
rodion
romanovitch
if
you
could
only
see
how
your
sister
s
eye
can
flash
sometimes
never
mind
my
being
drunk
at
this
moment
and
having
had
a
whole
glass
of
wine
i
am
speaking
the
truth
i
assure
you
that
this
glance
ha
haunted
my
dream
the
very
rustle
of
her
dress
wa
more
than
i
could
stand
at
last
i
really
began
to
think
that
i
might
become
epileptic
i
could
never
have
believed
that
i
could
be
moved
to
such
a
frenzy
it
wa
essential
indeed
to
be
reconciled
but
by
then
it
wa
impossible
and
imagine
what
i
did
then
to
what
a
pitch
of
stupidity
a
man
can
be
brought
by
frenzy
never
undertake
anything
in
a
frenzy
rodion
romanovitch
i
reflected
that
avdotya
romanovna
wa
after
all
a
beggar
ach
excuse
me
that
s
not
the
word
but
doe
it
matter
if
it
express
the
meaning
that
she
lived
by
her
work
that
she
had
her
mother
and
you
to
keep
ach
hang
it
you
are
frowning
again
and
i
resolved
to
offer
her
all
my
money
thirty
thousand
rouble
i
could
have
realised
then
if
she
would
run
away
with
me
here
to
petersburg
of
course
i
should
have
vowed
eternal
love
rapture
and
so
on
do
you
know
i
wa
so
wild
about
her
at
that
time
that
if
she
had
told
me
to
poison
marfa
petrovna
or
to
cut
her
throat
and
to
marry
herself
it
would
have
been
done
at
once
but
it
ended
in
the
catastrophe
of
which
you
know
already
you
can
fancy
how
frantic
i
wa
when
i
heard
that
marfa
petrovna
had
got
hold
of
that
scoundrelly
attorney
luzhin
and
had
almost
made
a
match
between
them
which
would
really
have
been
just
the
same
thing
a
i
wa
proposing
wouldn
t
it
wouldn
t
it
i
notice
that
you
ve
begun
to
be
very
attentive
you
interesting
young
man
svidrigaïlov
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
impatiently
he
wa
flushed
raskolnikov
saw
clearly
that
the
glass
or
glass
and
a
half
of
champagne
that
he
had
sipped
almost
unconsciously
wa
affecting
him
and
he
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
he
felt
very
suspicious
of
svidrigaïlov
well
after
what
you
have
said
i
am
fully
convinced
that
you
have
come
to
petersburg
with
design
on
my
sister
he
said
directly
to
svidrigaïlov
in
order
to
irritate
him
further
oh
nonsense
said
svidrigaïlov
seeming
to
rouse
himself
why
i
told
you
besides
your
sister
can
t
endure
yes
i
am
certain
that
she
can
t
but
that
s
not
the
are
you
so
sure
that
she
can
t
svidrigaïlov
screwed
up
his
eye
and
smiled
mockingly
you
are
right
she
doesn
t
love
me
but
you
can
never
be
sure
of
what
ha
passed
between
husband
and
wife
or
lover
and
mistress
there
s
always
a
little
corner
which
remains
a
secret
to
the
world
and
is
only
known
to
those
two
will
you
answer
for
it
that
avdotya
romanovna
regarded
me
with
aversion
from
some
word
you
ve
dropped
i
notice
that
you
still
have
design
and
of
course
evil
one
on
dounia
and
mean
to
carry
them
out
what
have
i
dropped
word
like
that
svidrigaïlov
asked
in
naïve
dismay
taking
not
the
slightest
notice
of
the
epithet
bestowed
on
his
design
why
you
are
dropping
them
even
now
why
are
you
so
frightened
what
are
you
so
afraid
of
now
me
afraid
afraid
of
you
you
have
rather
to
be
afraid
of
me
but
what
nonsense
i
ve
drunk
too
much
though
i
see
that
i
wa
almost
saying
too
much
again
damn
the
wine
hi
there
water
he
snatched
up
the
champagne
bottle
and
flung
it
without
ceremony
out
of
the
window
philip
brought
the
water
that
s
all
nonsense
said
svidrigaïlov
wetting
a
towel
and
putting
it
to
his
head
but
i
can
answer
you
in
one
word
and
annihilate
all
your
suspicion
do
you
know
that
i
am
going
to
get
married

told
me
so
did
i
i
ve
forgotten
but
i
couldn
t
have
told
you
so
for
certain
for
i
had
not
even
seen
my
betrothed
i
only
meant
to
but
now
i
really
have
a
betrothed
and
it
s
a
settled
thing
and
if
it
weren
t
that
i
have
business

can
t
be
put
off

would
have
taken
you
to
see

your
advice

corner
without

at
a
time
and
that
resslich

sly
hussy
i
tell
you

in
her
mind

and

a
profit
out
of
her
in
our
class
of
course
or
higher
she
told
me
the
father
wa
a
retired
official
who
ha
been
sitting
in
a
chair
for
the
last
three
year
with
his
leg
paralysed
the
mamma
she
said
wa
a
sensible
woman
there
is
a
son
serving
in
the
province
but
he
doesn
t
help
there
is
a
daughter
who
is
married
but
she
doesn
t
visit
them
and
they
ve
two
little
nephew
on
their
hand
a
though
their
own
child
were
not
enough
and
they
ve
taken
from
school
their
youngest
daughter
a
girl
who
ll
be
sixteen
in
another
month
so
that
then
she
can
be
married
she
wa
for
me
we
went
there
how
funny
it
wa
i
present
myself
a
landowner
a
widower
of
a
name
with
connection
with
a
fortune
what
if
i
am
fifty
and
she
is
not
sixteen
who
think
of
that
but
it
s
fascinating
isn
t
it
it
is
fascinating
you
should
have
seen
how
i
talked
to
the
papa
and
mamma
it
wa
worth
paying
to
have
seen
me
at
that
moment
she
come
in
curtsey
you
can
fancy
still
in
a
short
frock
an
unopened
bud
flushing
like
a
sunset
she
had
been
told
no
doubt
i
don
t
know
how
you
feel
about
female
face
but
to
my
mind
these
sixteen
year
these
childish
eye
shyness
and
tear
of
bashfulness
are
better
than
beauty
and
she
is
a
perfect
little
picture
too
fair
hair
in
little
curl
like
a
lamb
s
full
little
rosy
lip
tiny
foot
a
charmer
well
we
made
friend
i
told
them
i
wa
in
a
hurry
owing
to
domestic
circumstance
and
the
next
day
that
is
the
day
before
yesterday
we
were
betrothed
when
i
go
now
i
take
her
on
my
knee
at
once
and
keep
her
there
well
she
flush
like
a
sunset
and
i
kiss
her
every
minute
her
mamma
of
course
impress
on
her
that
this
is
her
husband
and
that
this
must
be
so
it
s
simply
delicious
the
present
betrothed
condition
is
perhaps
better
than
marriage
here
you
have
what
is
called
nature
et
la
i
ve
talked
to
her
twice
she
is
far
from
a
fool
sometimes
she
steal
a
look
at
me
that
positively
scorch
me
her
face
is
like
raphael
s
madonna
you
know
the
sistine
madonna
s
face
ha
something
fantastic
in
it
the
face
of
mournful
religious
ecstasy
haven
t
you
noticed
it
well
she
s
something
in
that
line
the
day
after
we
d
been
betrothed
i
bought
her
present
to
the
value
of
fifteen
hundred
rouble
a
set
of
diamond
and
another
of
pearl
and
a
silver
a
large
a
this
with
all
sort
of
thing
in
it
so
that
even
my
madonna
s
face
glowed
i
sat
her
on
my
knee
yesterday
and
i
suppose
rather
too
unceremoniously
she
flushed
crimson
and
the
tear
started
but
she
didn
t
want
to
show
it
we
were
left
alone
she
suddenly
flung
herself
on
my
neck
for
the
first
time
of
her
own
accord
put
her
little
arm
round
me
kissed
me
and
vowed
that
she
would
be
an
obedient
faithful
and
good
wife
would
make
me
happy
would
devote
all
her
life
every
minute
of
her
life
would
sacrifice
everything
everything
and
that
all
she
asks
in
return
is
my
and
that
she
want
nothing
nothing
more
from
me
no
you
ll
admit
that
to
hear
such
a
confession
alone
from
an
angel
of
sixteen
in
a
muslin
frock
with
little
curl
with
a
flush
of
maiden
shyness
in
her
cheek
and
tear
of
enthusiasm
in
her
eye
is
rather
fascinating
isn
t
it
fascinating
it
s
worth
paying
for
isn
t
it
well
listen
we
ll
go
to
see
my
betrothed
only
not
just
now
the
fact
is
this
monstrous
difference
in
age
and
development
excites
your
sensuality
will
you
really
make
such
a
marriage
why
of
course
everyone
think
of
himself
and
he
life
most
gaily
who
know
best
how
to
deceive
himself
but
why
are
you
so
keen
about
virtue
have
mercy
on
me
my
good
friend
i
am
a
sinful
man
but
you
have
provided
for
the
child
of
katerina
ivanovna
though
though
you
had
your
own
reason
i
understand
it
all
i
am
always
fond
of
child
very
fond
of
them
laughed
svidrigaïlov
i
can
tell
you
one
curious
instance
of
it
the
first
day
i
came
here
i
visited
various
haunt
after
seven
year
i
simply
rushed
at
them
you
probably
notice
that
i
am
not
in
a
hurry
to
renew
acquaintance
with
my
old
friend
i
shall
do
without
them
a
long
a
i
can
do
you
know
when
i
wa
with
marfa
petrovna
in
the
country
i
wa
haunted
by
the
thought
of
these
place
where
anyone
who
know
his
way
about
can
find
a
great
deal
yes
upon
my
soul
the
peasant
have
vodka
the
educated
young
people
shut
out
from
activity
waste
themselves
in
impossible
dream
and
vision
and
are
crippled
by
theory
jew
have
sprung
up
and
are
amassing
money
and
all
the
rest
give
themselves
up
to
debauchery
from
the
first
hour
the
town
reeked
of
it
familiar
odour
i
chanced
to
be
in
a
frightful
den
i
like
my
den
dirty
it
wa
a
dance
so
called
and
there
wa
a
such
a
i
never
saw
in
my
day
yes
there
you
have
progress
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
a
little
girl
of
thirteen
nicely
dressed
dancing
with
a
specialist
in
that
line
with
another
one
her
mother
wa
sitting
on
a
chair
by
the
wall
you
can
t
fancy
what
a
that
wa
the
girl
wa
ashamed
blushed
at
last
felt
insulted
and
began
to
cry
her
partner
seized
her
and
began
whirling
her
round
and
performing
before
her
everyone
laughed
and
i
like
your
public
even
the
public
they
laughed
and
shouted
serf
her
right
serf
her
right
shouldn
t
bring
child
well
it
s
not
my
business
whether
that
consoling
reflection
wa
logical
or
not
i
at
once
fixed
on
my
plan
sat
down
by
the
mother
and
began
by
saying
that
i
too
wa
a
stranger
and
that
people
here
were
and
that
they
couldn
t
distinguish
decent
folk
and
treat
them
with
respect
gave
her
to
understand
that
i
had
plenty
of
money
offered
to
take
them
home
in
my
carriage
i
took
them
home
and
got
to
know
them
they
were
lodging
in
a
miserable
little
hole
and
had
only
just
arrived
from
the
country
she
told
me
that
she
and
her
daughter
could
only
regard
my
acquaintance
a
an
honour
i
found
out
that
they
had
nothing
of
their
own
and
had
come
to
town
upon
some
legal
business
i
proffered
my
service
and
money
i
learnt
that
they
had
gone
to
the
dancing
saloon
by
mistake
believing
that
it
wa
a
genuine
dancing
class
i
offered
to
assist
in
the
young
girl
s
education
in
french
and
dancing
my
offer
wa
accepted
with
enthusiasm
a
an
honour
and
we
are
still
friendly
if
you
like
we
ll
go
and
see
them
only
not
just
stop
enough
of
your
vile
nasty
anecdote
depraved
vile
sensual
man
schiller
you
are
a
regular
schiller
la
vertu
se
nicher
but
you
know
i
shall
tell
you
these
thing
on
purpose
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
your
outcry
i
dare
say
i
can
see
i
am
ridiculous
myself
muttered
raskolnikov
angrily
svidrigaïlov
laughed
heartily
finally
he
called
philip
paid
his
bill
and
began
getting
up
i
say
but
i
am
drunk
he
said
it
s
been
a
i
should
rather
think
it
must
be
a
pleasure
cried
raskolnikov
getting
up
no
doubt
it
is
a
pleasure
for
a
profligate
to
describe
such
adventure
with
a
monstrous
project
of
the
same
sort
in
his
mind
especially
under
such
circumstance
and
to
such
a
man
a
me
it
s
stimulating
well
if
you
come
to
that
svidrigaïlov
answered
scrutinising
raskolnikov
with
some
surprise
if
you
come
to
that
you
are
a
thorough
cynic
yourself
you
ve
plenty
to
make
you
so
anyway
you
can
understand
a
great
deal
and
you
can
do
a
great
deal
too
but
enough
i
sincerely
regret
not
having
had
more
talk
with
you
but
i
shan
t
lose
sight
of
you
only
wait
a
svidrigaïlov
walked
out
of
the
restaurant
raskolnikov
walked
out
after
him
svidrigaïlov
wa
not
however
very
drunk
the
wine
had
affected
him
for
a
moment
but
it
wa
passing
off
every
minute
he
wa
preoccupied
with
something
of
importance
and
wa
frowning
he
wa
apparently
excited
and
uneasy
in
anticipation
of
something
his
manner
to
raskolnikov
had
changed
during
the
last
few
minute
and
he
wa
ruder
and
more
sneering
every
moment
raskolnikov
noticed
all
this
and
he
too
wa
uneasy
he
became
very
suspicious
of
svidrigaïlov
and
resolved
to
follow
him
they
came
out
on
to
the
pavement
you
go
to
the
right
and
i
to
the
left
or
if
you
like
the
other
way
only
mon
may
we
meet
and
he
walked
to
the
right
towards
the
hay
market
chapter
v
raskolnikov
walked
after
him
what
s
this
cried
svidrigaïlov
turning
round
i
thought
i
said
it
mean
that
i
am
not
going
to
lose
sight
of
you
what
both
stood
still
and
gazed
at
one
another
a
though
measuring
their
strength
from
all
your
half
tipsy
story
raskolnikov
observed
harshly
i
am
that
you
have
not
given
up
your
design
on
my
sister
but
are
pursuing
them
more
actively
than
ever
i
have
learnt
that
my
sister
received
a
letter
this
morning
you
have
hardly
been
able
to
sit
still
all
this
time
you
may
have
unearthed
a
wife
on
the
way
but
that
mean
nothing
i
should
like
to
make
certain
raskolnikov
could
hardly
have
said
himself
what
he
wanted
and
of
what
he
wished
to
make
certain
upon
my
word
i
ll
call
the
police
call
away
again
they
stood
for
a
minute
facing
each
other
at
last
svidrigaïlov
s
face
changed
having
satisfied
himself
that
raskolnikov
wa
not
frightened
at
his
threat
he
assumed
a
mirthful
and
friendly
air
what
a
fellow
i
purposely
refrained
from
referring
to
your
affair
though
i
am
devoured
by
curiosity
it
s
a
fantastic
affair
i
ve
put
it
off
till
another
time
but
you
re
enough
to
rouse
the
dead
well
let
u
go
only
i
warn
you
beforehand
i
am
only
going
home
for
a
moment
to
get
some
money
then
i
shall
lock
up
the
flat
take
a
cab
and
go
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
island
now
now
are
you
going
to
follow
me
i
m
coming
to
your
lodging
not
to
see
you
but
sofya
semyonovna
to
say
i
m
sorry
not
to
have
been
at
the
that
s
a
you
like
but
sofya
semyonovna
is
not
at
home
she
ha
taken
the
three
child
to
an
old
lady
of
high
rank
the
patroness
of
some
orphan
asylum
whom
i
used
to
know
year
ago
i
charmed
the
old
lady
by
depositing
a
sum
of
money
with
her
to
provide
for
the
three
child
of
katerina
ivanovna
and
subscribing
to
the
institution
a
well
i
told
her
too
the
story
of
sofya
semyonovna
in
full
detail
suppressing
nothing
it
produced
an
indescribable
effect
on
her
that
s
why
sofya
semyonovna
ha
been
invited
to
call
at
the
x
hotel
where
the
lady
is
staying
for
the
no
matter
i
ll
come
all
the
a
you
like
it
s
nothing
to
me
but
i
won
t
come
with
you
here
we
are
at
home
by
the
way
i
am
convinced
that
you
regard
me
with
suspicion
just
because
i
have
shown
such
delicacy
and
have
not
so
far
troubled
you
with
question
you
understand
it
struck
you
a
extraordinary
i
don
t
mind
betting
it
s
that
well
it
teach
one
to
show
delicacy
and
to
listen
at
door
ah
that
s
it
is
it
laughed
svidrigaïlov
yes
i
should
have
been
surprised
if
you
had
let
that
pas
after
all
that
ha
happened
though
i
did
understand
something
of
the
prank
you
had
been
up
to
and
were
telling
sofya
semyonovna
about
what
wa
the
meaning
of
it
perhaps
i
am
quite
behind
the
time
and
can
t
understand
for
goodness
sake
explain
it
my
dear
boy
expound
the
latest
theory
you
couldn
t
have
heard
anything
you
re
making
it
all
up
but
i
m
not
talking
about
that
though
i
did
hear
something
no
i
m
talking
of
the
way
you
keep
sighing
and
groaning
now
the
schiller
in
you
is
in
revolt
every
moment
and
now
you
tell
me
not
to
listen
at
door
if
that
s
how
you
feel
go
and
inform
the
police
that
you
had
this
mischance
you
made
a
little
mistake
in
your
theory
but
if
you
are
convinced
that
one
mustn
t
listen
at
door
but
one
may
murder
old
woman
at
one
s
pleasure

more
sensible
now

time

and
here

are
again
on
the
stair

a
cab

carriage

tired
of
it

for
a
drive
i
believe
it
will
come
on
to
rain
never
mind
we
ll
put
down
the
hood
svidrigaïlov
wa
already
in
the
carriage
raskolnikov
decided
that
his
suspicion
were
at
least
for
that
moment
unjust
without
answering
a
word
he
turned
and
walked
back
towards
the
hay
market
if
he
had
only
turned
round
on
his
way
he
might
have
seen
svidrigaïlov
get
out
not
a
hundred
pace
off
dismiss
the
cab
and
walk
along
the
pavement
but
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
could
see
nothing
intense
disgust
drew
him
away
from
svidrigaïlov
to
think
that
i
could
for
one
instant
have
looked
for
help
from
that
coarse
brute
that
depraved
sensualist
and
blackguard
he
cried
raskolnikov
s
judgment
wa
uttered
too
lightly
and
hastily
there
wa
something
about
svidrigaïlov
which
gave
him
a
certain
original
even
a
mysterious
character
a
concerned
his
sister
raskolnikov
wa
convinced
that
svidrigaïlov
would
not
leave
her
in
peace
but
it
wa
too
tiresome
and
unbearable
to
go
on
thinking
and
thinking
about
this
when
he
wa
alone
he
had
not
gone
twenty
pace
before
he
sank
a
usual
into
deep
thought
on
the
bridge
he
stood
by
the
railing
and
began
gazing
at
the
water
and
his
sister
wa
standing
close
by
him
he
met
her
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
but
passed
by
without
seeing
her
dounia
had
never
met
him
like
this
in
the
street
before
and
wa
struck
with
dismay
she
stood
still
and
did
not
know
whether
to
call
to
him
or
not
suddenly
she
saw
svidrigaïlov
coming
quickly
from
the
direction
of
the
hay
market
he
seemed
to
be
approaching
cautiously
he
did
not
go
on
to
the
bridge
but
stood
aside
on
the
pavement
doing
all
he
could
to
avoid
raskolnikov
s
seeing
him
he
had
observed
dounia
for
some
time
and
had
been
making
sign
to
her
she
fancied
he
wa
signalling
to
beg
her
not
to
speak
to
her
brother
but
to
come
to
him
that
wa
what
dounia
did
she
stole
by
her
brother
and
went
up
to
svidrigaïlov
let
u
make
haste
away
svidrigaïlov
whispered
to
her
i
don
t
want
rodion
romanovitch
to
know
of
our
meeting
i
must
tell
you
i
ve
been
sitting
with
him
in
the
restaurant
close
by
where
he
looked
me
up
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
him
he
ha
somehow
heard
of
my
letter
to
you
and
suspect
something
it
wasn
t
you
who
told
him
of
course
but
if
not
you
who
then
well
we
ve
turned
the
corner
now
dounia
interrupted
and
my
brother
won
t
see
u
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
no
further
with
you
speak
to
me
here
you
can
tell
it
all
in
the
in
the
first
place
i
can
t
say
it
in
the
street
secondly
you
must
hear
sofya
semyonovna
too
and
thirdly
i
will
show
you
some
paper
oh
well
if
you
won
t
agree
to
come
with
me
i
shall
refuse
to
give
any
explanation
and
go
away
at
once
but
i
beg
you
not
to
forget
that
a
very
curious
secret
of
your
beloved
brother
s
is
entirely
in
my
dounia
stood
still
hesitating
and
looked
at
svidrigaïlov
with
searching
eye
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
observed
quietly
the
town
is
not
the
country
and
even
in
the
country
you
did
me
more
harm
than
i
did
have
you
prepared
sofya
semyonovna
no
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
her
and
am
not
quite
certain
whether
she
is
at
home
now
but
most
likely
she
is
she
ha
buried
her
stepmother
she
is
not
likely
to
go
visiting
on
such
a
day
for
the
time
i
don
t
want
to
speak
to
anyone
about
it
and
i
half
regret
having
spoken
to
you
the
slightest
indiscretion
is
a
bad
a
betrayal
in
a
thing
like
this
i
live
there
in
that
house
we
are
coming
to
it
that
s
the
porter
of
our
house
he
know
me
very
well
you
see
he
s
bowing
he
see
i
m
coming
with
a
lady
and
no
doubt
he
ha
noticed
your
face
already
and
you
will
be
glad
of
that
if
you
are
afraid
of
me
and
suspicious
excuse
my
putting
thing
so
coarsely
i
haven
t
a
flat
to
myself
sofya
semyonovna
s
room
is
next
to
mine
she
lodge
in
the
next
flat
the
whole
floor
is
let
out
in
lodging
why
are
you
frightened
like
a
child
am
i
really
so
terrible
svidrigaïlov
s
lip
were
twisted
in
a
condescending
smile
but
he
wa
in
no
smiling
mood
his
heart
wa
throbbing
and
he
could
scarcely
breathe
he
spoke
rather
loud
to
cover
his
growing
excitement
but
dounia
did
not
notice
this
peculiar
excitement
she
wa
so
irritated
by
his
remark
that
she
wa
frightened
of
him
like
a
child
and
that
he
wa
so
terrible
to
her
though
i
know
that
you
are
not
a
man
of
honour
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
you
lead
the
way
she
said
with
apparent
composure
but
her
face
wa
very
pale
svidrigaïlov
stopped
at
sonia
s
room
allow
me
to
inquire
whether
she
is
at
home
she
is
not
how
unfortunate
but
i
know
she
may
come
quite
soon
if
she
s
gone
out
it
can
only
be
to
see
a
lady
about
the
orphan
their
mother
is
dead
i
ve
been
meddling
and
making
arrangement
for
them
if
sofya
semyonovna
doe
not
come
back
in
ten
minute
i
will
send
her
to
you
if
you
like
this
is
my
flat
these
are
my
two
room
madame
resslich
my
landlady
ha
the
next
room
now
look
this
way
i
will
show
you
my
chief
piece
of
evidence
this
door
from
my
bedroom
lead
into
two
perfectly
empty
room
which
are
to
let
here
they
are
you
must
look
into
them
with
some
svidrigaïlov
occupied
two
fairly
large
furnished
room
dounia
wa
looking
about
her
mistrustfully
but
saw
nothing
special
in
the
furniture
or
position
of
the
room
yet
there
wa
something
to
observe
for
instance
that
svidrigaïlov
s
flat
wa
exactly
between
two
set
of
almost
uninhabited
apartment
his
room
were
not
entered
directly
from
the
passage
but
through
the
landlady
s
two
almost
empty
room
unlocking
a
door
leading
out
of
his
bedroom
svidrigaïlov
showed
dounia
the
two
empty
room
that
were
to
let
dounia
stopped
in
the
doorway
not
knowing
what
she
wa
called
to
look
upon
but
svidrigaïlov
hastened
to
explain
look
here
at
this
second
large
room
notice
that
door
it
s
locked
by
the
door
stand
a
chair
the
only
one
in
the
two
room
i
brought
it
from
my
room
so
a
to
listen
more
conveniently
just
the
other
side
of
the
door
is
sofya
semyonovna
s
table
she
sat
there
talking
to
rodion
romanovitch
and
i
sat
here
listening
on
two
successive
evening
for
two
hour
each
time
and
of
course
i
wa
able
to
learn
something
what
do
you
think
you
listened
yes
i
did
now
come
back
to
my
room
we
can
t
sit
down
he
brought
avdotya
romanovna
back
into
his
and
offered
her
a
chair
he
sat
down
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
at
least
seven
foot
from
her
but
probably
there
wa
the
same
glow
in
his
eye
which
had
once
frightened
dounia
so
much
she
shuddered
and
once
more
looked
about
her
distrustfully
it
wa
an
involuntary
gesture
she
evidently
did
not
wish
to
betray
her
uneasiness
but
the
secluded
position
of
svidrigaïlov
s
lodging
had
suddenly
struck
her
she
wanted
to
ask
whether
his
landlady
at
least
were
at
home
but
pride
kept
her
from
asking
moreover
she
had
another
trouble
in
her
heart
incomparably
greater
than
fear
for
herself
she
wa
in
great
distress
here
is
your
letter
she
said
laying
it
on
the
table
can
it
be
true
what
you
write
you
hint
at
a
crime
committed
you
say
by
my
brother
you
hint
at
it
too
clearly
you
daren
t
deny
it
now
i
must
tell
you
that
i
d
heard
of
this
stupid
story
before
you
wrote
and
don
t
believe
a
word
of
it
it
s
a
disgusting
and
ridiculous
suspicion
i
know
the
story
and
why
and
how

this
speaking
hurriedly
and
for
an
instant
the
colour
rushed
to
her
face
if
you
didn
t
believe
it
how
could
you
risk
coming
alone
to
my
room
why
have
you
come
simply
from
curiosity
don

no
denying
that
you
are
a
brave
girl
upon
my
word
i
thought
you
would
have
asked
razumihin

did

think
of
him
surely
that
s
not
the
only
thing
you
are
building
on
no
not
on
that
but
on
his
own
word
he
came
here
on
two
successive
evening
to
see
sofya
semyonovna
i
ve
shown
you
where
they
sat
he
made
a
full
confession
to
her
he
is
a
murderer
he
killed
an
old
woman
a
pawnbroker
with
whom
he
had
pawned
thing
himself
he
killed
her
sister
too
a
pedlar
woman
called
lizaveta
who
happened
to
come
in
while
he
wa
murdering
her
sister
he
killed
them
with
an
axe
he
brought
with
him
he
murdered
them
to
rob
them
and
he
did
rob
them
he
took
money
and
various
thing
he
told
all
this
word
for
word
to
sofya
semyonovna
the
only
person
who
know
his
secret
but
she
ha
had
no
share
by
word
or
deed
in
the
murder
she
wa
a
horrified
at
it
a
you
are
now
don
t
be
anxious
she
won
t
betray
it
can
not
be
muttered
dounia
with
white
lip
she
gasped
for
breath
it
can
not
be
there
wa
not
the
slightest
cause
no
sort
of
ground
it
s
a
lie
a
lie
he
robbed
her
that
wa
the
cause
he
took
money
and
thing
it
s
true
that
by
his
own
admission
he
made
no
use
of
the
money
or
thing
but
hid
them
under
a
stone
where
they
are
now
but
that
wa
because
he
dared
not
make
use
of
but
how
could
he
steal
rob
how
could
he
dream
of
it
cried
dounia
and
she
jumped
up
from
the
chair
why
you
know
him
and
you
ve
seen
him
can
he
be
a
thief
she
seemed
to
be
imploring
svidrigaïlov
she
had
entirely
forgotten
her
fear
there
are
thousand
and
million
of
combination
and
possibility
avdotya
romanovna
a
thief
steal
and
know
he
is
a
scoundrel
but
i
ve
heard
of
a
gentleman
who
broke
open
the
mail
who
know
very
likely
he
thought
he
wa
doing
a
gentlemanly
thing
of
course
i
should
not
have
believed
it
myself
if
i
d
been
told
of
it
a
you
have
but
i
believe
my
own
ear
he
explained
all
the
cause
of
it
to
sofya
semyonovna
too
but
she
did
not
believe
her
ear
at
first
yet
she
believed
her
own
eye
at
what
were
the
cause
it
s
a
long
story
avdotya
romanovna
here
s
how
shall
i
tell
you
a
theory
of
a
sort
the
same
one
by
which
i
for
instance
consider
that
a
single
misdeed
is
permissible
if
the
principal
aim
is
right
a
solitary
wrongdoing
and
hundred
of
good
deed
it
s
galling
too
of
course
for
a
young
man
of
gift
and
overweening
pride
to
know
that
if
he
had
for
instance
a
paltry
three
thousand
his
whole
career
his
whole
future
would
be
differently
shaped
and
yet
not
to
have
that
three
thousand
add
to
that
nervous
irritability
from
hunger
from
lodging
in
a
hole
from
rag
from
a
vivid
sense
of
the
charm
of
his
social
position
and
his
sister
s
and
mother
s
position
too
above
all
vanity
pride
and
vanity
though
goodness
know
he
may
have
good
quality
too
i
am
not
blaming
him
please
don
t
think
it
besides
it
s
not
my
business
a
special
little
theory
came
in
too
a
theory
of
a
sort
dividing
mankind
you
see
into
material
and
superior
person
that
is
person
to
whom
the
law
doe
not
apply
owing
to
their
superiority
who
make
law
for
the
rest
of
mankind
the
material
that
is
it
s
all
right
a
a
theory
théorie
comme
une
napoleon
attracted
him
tremendously
that
is
what
affected
him
wa
that
a
great
many
men
of
genius
have
not
hesitated
at
wrongdoing
but
have
overstepped
the
law
without
thinking
about
it
he
seems
to
have
fancied
that
he
wa
a
genius
too
that
is
he
wa
convinced
of
it
for
a
time
he
ha
suffered
a
great
deal
and
is
still
suffering
from
the
idea
that
he
could
make
a
theory
but
wa
incapable
of
boldly
overstepping
the
law
and
so
he
is
not
a
man
of
genius
and
that
s
humiliating
for
a
young
man
of
any
pride
in
our
day
especially
but
remorse
you
deny
him
any
moral
feeling
then
is
he
like
that
ah
avdotya
romanovna
everything
is
in
a
muddle
now
not
that
it
wa
ever
in
very
good
order
russian
in
general
are
broad
in
their
idea
avdotya
romanovna
broad
like
their
land
and
exceedingly
disposed
to
the
fantastic
the
chaotic
but
it
s
a
misfortune
to
be
broad
without
a
special
genius
do
you
remember
what
a
lot
of
talk
we
had
together
on
this
subject
sitting
in
the
evening
on
the
terrace
after
supper
why
you
used
to
reproach
me
with
breadth
who
know
perhaps
we
were
talking
at
the
very
time
when
he
wa
lying
here
thinking
over
his
plan
there
are
no
sacred
tradition
amongst
u
especially
in
the
educated
class
avdotya
romanovna
at
the
best
someone
will
make
them
up
somehow
for
himself
out
of
book
or
from
some
old
chronicle
but
those
are
for
the
most
part
the
learned
and
all
old
fogey
so
that
it
would
be
almost
in
a
man
of
society
you
know
my
opinion
in
general
though
i
never
blame
anyone
i
do
nothing
at
all
i
persevere
in
that
but
we
ve
talked
of
this
more
than
once
before
i
wa
so
happy
indeed
a
to
interest
you
in
my
opinion
you
are
very
pale
avdotya
i
know
his
theory
i
read
that
article
of
his
about
men
to
whom
all
is
permitted
razumihin
brought
it
to
mr
razumihin
your
brother
s
article
in
a
magazine
is
there
such
an
article
i
didn
t
know
it
must
be
interesting
but
where
are
you
going
avdotya
romanovna
i
want
to
see
sofya
semyonovna
dounia
articulated
faintly
how

i
go
to
her
she
ha
come
in
perhaps
i
must
see
her
at
once
perhaps
she
avdotya
romanovna
could
not
finish
her
breath
literally
failed
her
sofya
semyonovna
will
not
be
back
till
night

least

believe
not
she
wa
to
have
been
back
at
once
but
if
not
then
she
will
not
be
in
till

all
the
time
i
don
t
believe

cried
dounia
completely
losing
her
head
almost
fainting
she
sank
on
to
a
chair
which
svidrigaïlov
made
haste
to
give
her
avdotya
romanovna
what

some
water

water
over

and
came
to

and
now

is
locked
when
did
you
manage
to
lock
it
we
couldn
t
be
shouting
all
over
the
flat
on
such
a
subject
i
am
far
from
jeering
it
s
simply
that
i
m
sick
of
talking
like
this
but
how
can

in
such
a
state
do

to
fury
and

thoroughly

dounia

svidrigaïlov
sat
down
beside
her
it
all
depends
on
you
on
you
on
you
alone
he
began
with
glowing
eye
almost
in
a
whisper
and
hardly
able
to
utter
the
word
for
emotion
dounia
drew
back
from
him
in
alarm
he

wa
trembling
all
over
you
one
word
from
you

that
you
are
killing
me
he
wa
almost
beginning
to
rave
something
seemed
suddenly
to
go
to
his
head
dounia
jumped
up
and
rushed
to
the
door
open
it
open
it
she
called
shaking
the
door
open
it
is
there
no
one
there
svidrigaïlov
got
up
and
came
to
himself
his
still
trembling
lip
slowly
broke
into
an
angry
mocking
smile
there
is
no
one
at
home
he
said
quietly
and
emphatically
the
landlady
ha
gone
out
and
it
s
waste
of
time
to
shout
like
that
you
are
only
exciting
yourself
where
is
the
key
open
the
door
at
once
at
once
base
man
i
have
lost
the
key
and
can
not
find
this
is
an
outrage
cried
dounia
turning
pale
a
death
she
rushed
to
the
furthest
corner
where
she
made
haste
to
barricade
herself
with
a
little
table
she
did
not
scream
but
she
fixed
her
eye
on
her
tormentor
and
watched
every
movement
he
made
svidrigaïlov
remained
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
facing
her
he
wa
positively
composed
at
least
in
appearance
but
his
face
wa
pale
a
before
the
mocking
smile
did
not
leave
his
face
you
spoke
of
outrage
just
now
avdotya
romanovna
in
that
case
you
may
be
sure
i
ve
taken
measure
sofya
semyonovna
is
not
at
home
the
kapernaumovs
are
far
away
there
are
five
locked
room
between
i
am
at
least
twice
a
strong
a
you
are
and
i
have
nothing
to
fear
besides
for
you
could
not
complain
afterwards
you
surely
would
not
be
willing
actually
to
betray
your
brother
besides
no
one
would
believe
you
how
should
a
girl
have
come
alone
to
visit
a
solitary
man
in
his
lodging
so
that
even
if
you
do
sacrifice
your
brother
you

svidrigaïlov
sat
down
on
the
sofa
about
eight
step
from
dounia
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
now
of
his
unbending
determination
besides
she
knew
him
suddenly
she
pulled
out
of
her
pocket
a
revolver
cocked
it
and
laid
it
in
her
hand
on
the

to
have
forgotten
how
you
softened
to
me
in
the
heat
of
propaganda
i
saw
it
in
your
eye
do
you
remember
that
moonlight
night
when
the
nightingale
wa
singing
that
s
a
lie
there
wa
a
flash
of
fury
in
dounia
s
eye
that
s
a
lie
and
a
libel
a
lie
well
if
you
like
it

a
lie
i
made
it
up

thing
he
smiled
i
know
you
will
shoot
you
pretty
wild
creature
well
shoot
away
dounia
raised
the
revolver
and
deadly
pale
gazed
at
him
measuring
the
distance
and
awaiting
the
first
movement
on
his
part
her
lower
lip
wa
white
and
quivering
and
her
big
black
eye
flashed
like
fire
he
had
never
seen
her
so
handsome
the
fire
glowing
in
her
eye
at
the
moment
she
raised
the
revolver
seemed
to
kindle
him
and
there
wa
a
pang
of
anguish
in
his
heart
he
took
a
step
forward
and
a
shot
rang
out
the
bullet
grazed
his
hair
and
flew
into
the
wall
behind
he
stood
still
and
laughed
softly
the
wasp
ha
stung
me
she
aimed
straight
at
my
head
what
s
this
blood
he
pulled
out
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
the
blood
which
flowed
in
a
thin
stream
down
his
right
temple
the
bullet
seemed
to
have
just
grazed
the
skin
dounia
lowered
the
revolver
and
looked
at
svidrigaïlov
not
so
much
in
terror
a
in
a
sort
of
wild
amazement
she
seemed
not
to
understand
what
she
wa
doing
and
what
wa
going
on
well
you
missed
fire
again
i
ll
wait
said
svidrigaïlov
softly
still
smiling
but
gloomily
if
you
go
on
like
that
i
shall
have
time
to
seize
you
before
you
cock
dounia
started
quickly
cocked
the
pistol
and
again
raised
it
let
me
be
she
cried
in
despair
i
swear
i
ll
shoot
again
i
i
ll
kill
well
at
three
pace
you
can
hardly
help
it
but
if
you
don
t
his
eye
flashed
and
he
took
two
step
forward
dounia
shot
again
it
missed
fire
you
haven
t
loaded
it
properly
never
mind
you
have
another
charge
there
get
it
ready
i
ll
he
stood
facing
her
two
pace
away
waiting
and
gazing
at
her
with
wild
determination
with
feverishly
passionate
stubborn
set
eye
dounia
saw
that
he
would
sooner
die
than
let
her
go
and
now
of
course
she
would
kill
him
at
two
pace
suddenly
she
flung
away
the
revolver
she
s
dropped
it
said
svidrigaïlov
with
surprise
and
he
drew
a
deep
breath
a
weight
seemed
to
have
rolled
from
his
heart
perhaps
not
only
the
fear
of
death
indeed
he
may
scarcely
have
felt
it
at
that
moment
it
wa
the
deliverance
from
another
feeling
darker
and
more
bitter
which
he
could
not
himself
have
defined
he
went
to
dounia
and
gently
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
she
did
not
resist
but
trembling
like
a
leaf
looked
at
him
with
suppliant
eye
he
tried
to
say
something
but
his
lip
moved
without
being
able
to
utter
a
sound
let
me
go
dounia
implored
svidrigaïlov
shuddered
her
voice
now
wa
quite
different
then
you
don
t
love
me
he
asked
softly
dounia
shook
her
head
and
and
you
can
t
never
he
whispered
in
despair
never
there
followed
a
moment
of
terrible
dumb
struggle
in
the
heart
of
svidrigaïlov
he
looked
at
her
with
an
indescribable
gaze
suddenly
he
withdrew
his
arm
turned
quickly
to
the
window
and
stood
facing
it
another
moment
passed
here
s
the
he
took
it
out
of
the
left
pocket
of
his
coat
and
laid
it
on
the
table
behind
him
without
turning
or
looking
at
dounia
take
it
make
haste
he
looked
stubbornly
out
of
the
window
dounia
went
up
to
the
table
to
take
the
key
make
haste
make
haste
repeated
svidrigaïlov
still
without
turning
or
moving
but
there
seemed
a
terrible
significance
in
the
tone
of
that
make
dounia
understood
it
snatched
up
the
key
flew
to
the
door
unlocked
it
quickly
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
a
minute
later
beside
herself
she
ran
out
on
to
the
canal
bank
in
the
direction
of
bridge
svidrigaïlov
remained
three
minute
standing
at
the
window
at
last
he
slowly
turned
looked
about
him
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
a
strange
smile
contorted
his
face
a
pitiful
sad
weak
smile
a
smile
of
despair
the
blood
which
wa
already
getting
dry
smeared
his
hand
he
looked
angrily
at
it
then
wetted
a
towel
and
washed
his
temple
the
revolver
which
dounia
had
flung
away
lay
near
the
door
and
suddenly
caught
his
eye
he
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
it
wa
a
little
pocket
revolver
of
construction
there
were
still
two
charge
and
one
capsule
left
in
it
it
could
be
fired
again
he
thought
a
little
put
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
took
his
hat
and
went
out
chapter
vi
he
spent
that
evening
till
ten
o
clock
going
from
one
low
haunt
to
another
katia
too
turned
up
and
sang
another
gutter
song
how
a
certain
villain
and
tyrant
began
kissing
svidrigaïlov
treated
katia
and
the
and
some
singer
and
the
waiter
and
two
little
clerk
he
wa
particularly
drawn
to
these
clerk
by
the
fact
that
they
both
had
crooked
nose
one
bent
to
the
left
and
the
other
to
the
right
they
took
him
finally
to
a
pleasure
garden
where
he
paid
for
their
entrance
there
wa
one
lanky
and
three
bush
in
the
garden
besides
a
vauxhall
which
wa
in
reality
a
where
tea
too
wa
served
and
there
were
a
few
green
table
and
chair
standing
round
it
a
chorus
of
wretched
singer
and
a
drunken
but
exceedingly
depressed
german
clown
from
munich
with
a
red
nose
entertained
the
public
the
clerk
quarrelled
with
some
other
clerk
and
a
fight
seemed
imminent
svidrigaïlov
wa
chosen
to
decide
the
dispute
he
listened
to
them
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
they
shouted
so
loud
that
there
wa
no
possibility
of
understanding
them
the
only
fact
that
seemed
certain
wa
that
one
of
them
had
stolen
something
and
had
even
succeeded
in
selling
it
on
the
spot
to
a
jew
but
would
not
share
the
spoil
with
his
companion
finally
it
appeared
that
the
stolen
object
wa
a
teaspoon
belonging
to
the
vauxhall
it
wa
missed
and
the
affair
began
to
seem
troublesome
svidrigaïlov
paid
for
the
spoon
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
garden
it
wa
about
six
o
clock
he
had
not
drunk
a
drop
of
wine
all
this
time
and
had
ordered
tea
more
for
the
sake
of
appearance
than
anything
it
wa
a
dark
and
stifling
evening
threatening
came
over
the
sky
about
ten
o
clock
there
wa
a
clap
of
thunder
and
the
rain
came
down
like
a
waterfall
the
water
fell
not
in
drop
but
beat
on
the
earth
in
stream
there
were
flash
of
lightning
every
minute
and
each
flash
lasted
while
one
could
count
five
drenched
to
the
skin
he
went
home
locked
himself
in
opened
the
bureau
took
out
all
his
money
and
tore
up
two
or
three
paper
then
putting
the
money
in
his
pocket
he
wa
about
to
change
his
clothes
but
looking
out
of
the
window
and
listening
to
the
thunder
and
the
rain
he
gave
up
the
idea
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
of
the
room
without
locking
the
door
he
went
straight
to
sonia

wonderingly
at

all
ran
away
at
once
in
indescribable
terror
svidrigaïlov
sat
down
at
the
table
and
asked
sonia
to

timidly

i
won
t

good
advice
when
you

sonia
too
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
looked
in
dismay
at
svidrigaïlov
she
longed
to
speak
to
ask
a
question
but
for
the
first
moment
she
did
not
dare
and
did
not
know
how
to
begin
how
can
you
how
can
you
be
going
now
in
such
rain
why
be
starting
for
america
and
be
stopped
by
rain
ha
ha
sofya
semyonovna
my
dear
live
and
live
long
you
will
be
of
use
to
others
by
the
way
tell
razumihin
i
send
my
greeting
to
him
tell
him
arkady
ivanovitch
svidrigaïlov
sends
his
greeting
be
sure
he
went
out
leaving
sonia
in
a
state
of
wondering
anxiety
and
vague
apprehension
it
appeared
afterwards
that
on
the
same
evening
at
twenty
past
eleven
he
made
another
very
eccentric
and
unexpected
visit
the
rain
still
persisted
drenched
to
the
skin
he
walked
into
the
little
flat
where
the
parent
of
his
betrothed
lived
in
third
street
in
vassilyevsky
island
he
knocked
some
time
before
he
wa
admitted
and
his
visit
at
first
caused
great
perturbation
but
svidrigaïlov
could
be
very
fascinating
when
he
liked
so
that
the
first
and
indeed
very
intelligent
surmise
of
the
sensible
parent
that
svidrigaïlov
had
probably
had
so
much
to
drink
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
wa
doing
vanished
immediately
the
decrepit
father
wa
wheeled
in
to
see
svidrigaïlov
by
the
tender
and
sensible
mother
who
a
usual
began
the
conversation
with
various
irrelevant
question
she
never
asked
a
direct
question
but
began
by
smiling
and
rubbing
her
hand
and
then
if
she
were
obliged
to
ascertain
something
for
instance
when
svidrigaïlov
would
like
to
have
the
wedding
she
would
begin
by
interested
and
almost
eager
question
about
paris
and
the
court
life
there
and
only
by
degree
brought
the
conversation
round
to
third
street
on
other
occasion
this
had
of
course
been
very
impressive
but
this
time
arkady
ivanovitch
seemed
particularly
impatient
and
insisted
on
seeing
his
betrothed
at
once
though
he
had
been
informed
to
begin
with
that
she
had
already
gone
to
bed
the
girl
of
course
appeared
svidrigaïlov
informed
her
at
once
that
he
wa
obliged
by
very
important
affair
to
leave
petersburg
for
a
time
and
therefore
brought
her
fifteen
thousand
rouble
and
begged
her
accept
them
a
a
present
from
him
a
he
had
long
been
intending
to
make
her
this
trifling
present
before
their
wedding
the
logical
connection
of
the
present
with
his
immediate
departure
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
visiting
them
for
that
purpose
in
pouring
rain
at
midnight
wa
not
made
clear
but
it
all
went
off
very
well
even
the
inevitable
ejaculation
of
wonder
and
regret
the
inevitable
question
were
extraordinarily
few
and
restrained
on
the
other
hand
the
gratitude
expressed
wa
most
glowing
and
wa
reinforced
by
tear
from
the
most
sensible
of
mother
svidrigaïlov
got
up
laughed
kissed
his
betrothed
patted
her
cheek
declared
he
would
soon
come
back
and
noticing
in
her
eye
together
with
childish
curiosity
a
sort
of
earnest
dumb
inquiry
reflected
and
kissed
her
again
though
he
felt
sincere
anger
inwardly
at
the
thought
that
his
present
would
be
immediately
locked
up
in
the
keeping
of
the
most
sensible
of
mother
he
went
away
leaving
them
all
in
a
state
of
extraordinary
excitement
but
the
tender
mamma
speaking
quietly
in
a
half
whisper
settled
some
of
the
most
important
of
their
doubt
concluding
that
svidrigaïlov
wa
a
great
man
a
man
of
great
affair
and
connection
and
of
great
wealth
there
wa
no
knowing
what
he
had
in
his
mind
he
would
start
off
on
a
journey
and
give
away
money
just
a
the
fancy
took
him
so
that
there
wa
nothing
surprising
about
it
of
course
it
wa
strange
that
he
wa
wet
through
but
englishman
for
instance
are
even
more
eccentric
and
all
these
people
of
high
society
didn
t
think
of
what
wa
said
of
them
and
didn
t
stand
on
ceremony
possibly
indeed
he
came
like
that
on
purpose
to
show
that
he
wa
not
afraid
of
anyone
above
all
not
a
word
should
be
said
about
it
for
god
know
what
might
come
of
it
and
the
money
must
be
locked
up
and
it
wa
most
fortunate
that
fedosya
the
cook
had
not
left
the
kitchen
and
above
all
not
a
word
must
be
said
to
that
old
cat
madame
resslich
and
so
on
and
so
on
they
sat
up
whispering
till
two
o
clock
but
the
girl
went
to
bed
much
earlier
amazed
and
rather
sorrowful
svidrigaïlov
meanwhile
exactly
at
midnight
crossed
the
bridge
on
the
way
back
to
the
mainland
the
rain
had
ceased
and
there
wa
a
roaring
wind
he
began
shivering
and
for
one
moment
he
gazed
at
the
black
water
of
the
little
neva
with
a
look
of
special
interest
even
inquiry
but
he
soon
felt
it
very
cold
standing
by
the
water
he
turned
and
went
towards
y
prospect
he
walked
along
that
endless
street
for
a
long
time
almost
half
an
hour
more
than
once
stumbling
in
the
dark
on
the
wooden
pavement
but
continually
looking
for
something
on
the
right
side
of
the
street
he
had
noticed
passing
through
this
street
lately
that
there
wa
a
hotel
somewhere
towards
the
end
built
of
wood
but
fairly
large
and
it
name
he
remembered
wa
something
like
adrianople
he
wa
not
mistaken
the
hotel
wa
so
conspicuous
in
that
place
that
he
could
not
fail
to
see
it
even
in
the
dark
it
wa
a
long
blackened
wooden
building
and
in
spite
of
the
late
hour
there
were
light
in
the
window
and
sign
of
life
within
he
went
in
and
asked
a
ragged
fellow
who
met
him
in
the
corridor
for
a
room
the
latter
scanning
svidrigaïlov
pulled
himself
together
and
led
him
at
once
to
a
close
and
tiny
room
in
the
distance
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
under
the
stair
there
wa
no
other
all
were
occupied
the
ragged
fellow
looked
inquiringly
is
there
tea
asked
svidrigaïlov
yes
what
else
is
there
veal
vodka
bring
me
tea
and
and
you
want
nothing
else
he
asked
with
apparent
surprise
nothing
the
ragged
man
went
away
completely
disillusioned
it
must
be
a
nice
place
thought
svidrigaïlov
how
wa
it
i
didn
t
know
it
i
expect
i
look
a
if
i
came
from
a
café
chantant
and
have
had
some
adventure
on
the
way
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
who
stayed
here
he
lighted
the
candle
and
looked
at
the
room
more
carefully
it
wa
a
room
so
that
svidrigaïlov
could
only
just
stand
up
in
it
it
had
one
window
the
bed
which
wa
very
dirty
and
the
chair
and
table
almost
filled
it
up
the
wall
looked
a
though
they
were
made
of
plank
covered
with
shabby
paper
so
torn
and
dusty
that
the
pattern
wa
indistinguishable
though
the
general
colour
yellow
could
still
be
made
out
one
of
the
wall
wa
cut
short
by
the
sloping
ceiling
though
the
room
wa
not
an
attic
but
just
under
the
stair
svidrigaïlov
set
down
the
candle
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
sank
into
thought
but
a
strange
persistent
murmur
which
sometimes
rose
to
a
shout
in
the
next
room
attracted
his
attention
the
murmur
had
not
ceased
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
he
listened
someone
wa
upbraiding
and
almost
tearfully
scolding
but
he
heard
only
one
voice
svidrigaïlov
got
up
shaded
the
light
with
his
hand
and
at
once
he
saw
light
through
a
crack
in
the
wall
he
went
up
and
peeped
through
the
room
which
wa
somewhat
larger
than
his
had
two
occupant
one
of
them
a
very
man
with
a
red
inflamed
face
wa
standing
in
the
pose
of
an
orator
without
his
coat
with
his
leg
wide
apart
to
preserve
his
balance
and
smiting
himself
on
the
breast
he
reproached
the
other
with
being
a
beggar
with
having
no
standing
whatever
he
declared
that
he
had
taken
the
other
out
of
the
gutter
and
he
could
turn
him
out
when
he
liked
and
that
only
the
finger
of
providence
see
it
all
the
object
of
his
reproach
wa
sitting
in
a
chair
and
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
want
dreadfully
to
sneeze
but
can
t
he
sometimes
turned
sheepish
and
befogged
eye
on
the
speaker
but
obviously
had
not
the
slightest
idea
what
he
wa
talking
about
and
scarcely
heard
it
a
candle
wa
burning
down
on
the
table
there
were
a
nearly
empty
bottle
of
vodka
bread
and
cucumber
and
glass
with
the
dreg
of
stale
tea
after
gazing
attentively
at
this
svidrigaïlov
turned
away
indifferently
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
the
ragged
attendant
returning
with
the
tea
could
not
resist
asking
him
again
whether
he
didn
t
want
anything
more
and
again
receiving
a
negative
reply
finally
withdrew
svidrigaïlov
made
haste
to
drink
a
glass
of
tea
to
warm
himself
but
could
not
eat
anything
he
began
to
feel
feverish
he
took
off
his
coat
and
wrapping
himself
in
the
blanket
lay
down
on
the
bed
he
wa
annoyed
it
would
have
been
better
to
be
well
for
the
occasion
he
thought
with
a
smile
the
room
wa
close
the
candle
burnt
dimly
the
wind
wa
roaring
outside
he
heard
a
mouse
scratching
in
the
corner
and
the
room
smelt
of
mouse
and
of
leather
he
lay
in
a
sort
of
reverie
one
thought
followed
another
he
felt
a
longing
to
fix
his
imagination
on
something
it
must
be
a
garden
under
the
window
he
thought
there
s
a
sound
of
tree
how
i
dislike
the
sound
of
tree
on
a
stormy
night
in
the
dark
they
give
one
a
horrid
he
remembered
how
he
had
disliked
it
when
he
passed
petrovsky
park
just
now
this
reminded
him
of
the
bridge
over
the
little
neva
and
he
felt
cold
again
a
he
had
when
standing
there
i
never
have
liked
water
he
thought
even
in
a
landscape
and
he
suddenly
smiled
again
at
a
strange
idea
surely
now
all
these
question
of
taste
and
comfort
ought
not
to
matter
but
i
ve
become
more
particular
like
an
animal
that
pick
out
a
special
place
for
such
an
occasion
i
ought
to
have
gone
into
the
petrovsky
park
i
suppose
it
seemed
dark
cold
a
though
i
were
seeking
pleasant
sensation
by
the
way
why
haven
t
i
put
out
the
candle
he
blew
it
out
they
ve
gone
to
bed
next
door
he
thought
not
seeing
the
light
at
the
crack
well
now
marfa
petrovna
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
turn
up
it
s
dark
and
the
very
time
and
place
for
you
but
now
you
won
t
come
he
suddenly
recalled
how
an
hour
before
carrying
out
his
design
on
dounia
he
had
recommended
raskolnikov
to
trust
her
to
razumihin
s
keeping
i
suppose
i
really
did
say
it
a
raskolnikov
guessed
to
tease
myself
but
what
a
rogue
that
raskolnikov
is
he
s
gone
through
a
good
deal
he
may
be
a
successful
rogue
in
time
when
he
s
got
over
his
nonsense
but
now
he
s
eager
for
life
these
young
men
are
contemptible
on
that
point
but
hang
the
fellow
let
him
please
himself
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
he
could
not
get
to
sleep
by
degree
dounia
s
image
rose
before
him
and
a
shudder
ran
over
him
no
i
must
give
up
all
that
now
he
thought
rousing
himself
i
must
think
of
something
else
it
s
queer
and
funny
i
never
had
a
great
hatred
for
anyone
i
never
particularly
desired
to
avenge
myself
even
and
that
s
a
bad
sign
a
bad
sign
a
bad
sign
i
never
liked
quarrelling
either
and
never
lost
my
temper
that
s
a
bad
sign
too
and
the
promise
i
made
her
just
now
too
damnation
but
who
know
perhaps
she
would
have
made
a
new
man
of
me
somehow
he
ground
his
teeth
and
sank
into
silence
again
again
dounia
s
image
rose
before
him
just
a
she
wa
when
after
shooting
the
first
time
she
had
lowered
the
revolver
in
terror
and
gazed
blankly
at
him
so
that
he
might
have
seized
her
twice
over
and
she
would
not
have
lifted
a
hand
to
defend
herself
if
he
had
not
reminded
her
he
recalled
how
at
that
instant
he
felt
almost
sorry
for
her
how
he
had
felt
a
pang
at
his
heart
aïe
damnation
these
thought
again
i
must
put
it
away
he
wa
dozing
off
the
feverish
shiver
had
ceased
when
suddenly
something
seemed
to
run
over
his
arm
and
leg
under
the
bedclothes
he
started
ugh
hang
it
i
believe
it
s
a
mouse
he
thought
that
s
the
veal
i
left
on
the
he
felt
fearfully
disinclined
to
pull
off
the
blanket
get
up
get
cold
but
all
at
once
something
unpleasant
ran
over
his
leg
again
he
pulled
off
the
blanket
and
lighted
the
candle
shaking
with
feverish
chill
he
bent
down
to
examine
the
bed
there
wa
nothing
he
shook
the
blanket
and
suddenly
a
mouse
jumped
out
on
the
sheet
he
tried
to
catch
it
but
the
mouse
ran
to
and
fro
in
zigzag
without
leaving
the
bed
slipped
between
his
finger
ran
over
his
hand
and
suddenly
darted
under
the
pillow
he
threw
down
the
pillow
but
in
one
instant
felt
something
leap
on
his
chest
and
dart
over
his
body
and
down
his
back
under
his
shirt
he
trembled
nervously
and
woke
up
the
room
wa
dark
he
wa
lying
on
the
bed
and
wrapped
up
in
the
blanket
a
before
the
wind
wa
howling
under
the
window
how
disgusting
he
thought
with
annoyance
he
got
up
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bedstead
with
his
back
to
the
window
it
s
better
not
to
sleep
at
all
he
decided
there
wa
a
cold
damp
draught
from
the
window
however
without
getting
up
he
drew
the
blanket
over
him
and
wrapped
himself
in
it
he
wa
not
thinking
of
anything
and
did
not
want
to
think
but
one
image
rose
after
another
incoherent
scrap
of
thought
without
beginning
or
end
passed
through
his
mind
he
sank
into
drowsiness
perhaps
the
cold
or
the
dampness
or
the
dark
or
the
wind
that
howled
under
the
window
and
tossed
the
tree
roused
a
sort
of
persistent
craving
for
the
fantastic
he
kept
dwelling
on
image
of
flower
he
fancied
a
charming
flower
garden
a
bright
warm
almost
hot
day
a
holiday
trinity
day
a
fine
sumptuous
country
cottage
in
the
english
taste
overgrown
with
fragrant
flower
with
flower
bed
going
round
the
house
the
porch
wreathed
in
climber
wa
surrounded
with
bed
of
rose
a
light
cool
staircase
carpeted
with
rich
rug
wa
decorated
with
rare
plant
in
china
pot
he
noticed
particularly
in
the
window
nosegay
of
tender
white
heavily
fragrant
narcissus
bending
over
their
bright
green
thick
long
stalk
he
wa
reluctant
to
move
away
from
them
but
he
went
up
the
stair
and
came
into
a
large
high
and
again
everywhere
at
the
window
the
door
on
to
the
balcony
and
on
the
balcony
itself
were
flower
the
floor
were
strewn
with
fragrant
hay
the
window
were
open
a
fresh
cool
light
air
came
into
the
room
the
bird
were
chirruping
under
the
window
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
on
a
table
covered
with
a
white
satin
shroud
stood
a
coffin
the
coffin
wa
covered
with
white
silk
and
edged
with
a
thick
white
frill
wreath
of
flower
surrounded
it
on
all
side
among
the
flower
lay
a
girl
in
a
white
muslin
dress
with
her
arm
crossed
and
pressed
on
her
bosom
a
though
carved
out
of
marble
but
her
loose
fair
hair
wa
wet
there
wa
a
wreath
of
rose
on
her
head
the
stern
and
already
rigid
profile
of
her
face
looked
a
though
chiselled
of
marble
too
and
the
smile
on
her
pale
lip
wa
full
of
an
immense
unchildish
misery
and
sorrowful
appeal
svidrigaïlov
knew
that
girl
there
wa
no
holy
image
no
burning
candle
beside
the
coffin
no
sound
of
prayer
the
girl
had
drowned
herself
she
wa
only
fourteen
but
her
heart
wa
broken
and
she
had
destroyed
herself
crushed
by
an
insult
that
had
appalled
and
amazed
that
childish
soul
had
smirched
that
angel
purity
with
unmerited
disgrace
and
torn
from
her
a
last
scream
of
despair
unheeded
and
brutally
disregarded
on
a
dark
night
in
the
cold
and
wet
while
the
wind
howled
svidrigaïlov
came
to
himself
got
up
from
the
bed
and
went
to
the
window
he
felt
for
the
latch
and
opened
it
the
wind
lashed
furiously
into
the
little
room
and
stung
his
face
and
his
chest
only
covered
with
his
shirt
a
though
with
frost
under
the
window
there
must
have
been
something
like
a
garden
and
apparently
a
pleasure
garden
there
too
probably
there
were
and
singing
in
the
daytime
now
drop
of
rain
flew
in
at
the
window
from
the
tree
and
bush
it
wa
dark
a
in
a
cellar
so
that
he
could
only
just
make
out
some
dark
blur
of
object
svidrigaïlov
bending
down
with
elbow
on
the
gazed
for
five
minute
into
the
darkness
the
boom
of
a
cannon
followed
by
a
second
one
resounded
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
ah
the
signal
the
river
is
overflowing
he
thought
by
morning
it
will
be
swirling
down
the
street
in
the
lower
part
flooding
the
basement
and
cellar
the
cellar
rat
will
swim
out
and
men
will
curse
in
the
rain
and
wind
a
they
drag
their
rubbish
to
their
upper
storey
what
time
is
it
now
and
he
had
hardly
thought
it
when
somewhere
near
a
clock
on
the
wall
ticking
away
hurriedly
struck
three
aha
it
will
be
light
in
an
hour
why
wait
i
ll
go
out
at
once
straight
to
the
park
i
ll
choose
a
great
bush
there
drenched
with
rain
so
that
a
soon
a
one
s
shoulder
touch
it
million
of
drop
drip
on
one
s
he
moved
away
from
the
window
shut
it
lighted
the
candle
put
on
his
waistcoat
his
overcoat
and
his
hat
and
went
out
carrying
the
candle
into
the
passage
to
look
for
the
ragged
attendant
who
would
be
asleep
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
and
all
sort
of
rubbish
to
pay
him
for
the
room
and
leave
the
hotel
it
s
the
best
minute
i
couldn
t
choose
a
he
walked
for
some
time
through
a
long
narrow
corridor
without
finding
anyone
and
wa
just
going
to
call
out
when
suddenly
in
a
dark
corner
between
an
old
cupboard
and
the
door
he
caught
sight
of
a
strange
object
which
seemed
to
be
alive
he
bent
down
with
the
candle
and
saw
a
little
girl
not
more
than
five
year
old
shivering
and
cry
with
her
clothes
a
wet
a
a
soaking
she
did
not
seem
afraid
of
svidrigaïlov
but
looked
at
him
with
blank
amazement
out
of
her
big
black
eye
now
and
then
she
sobbed
a
child
do
when
they
have
been
cry
a
long
time
but
are
beginning
to
be
comforted
the
child
s
face
wa
pale
and
tired
she
wa
numb
with
cold
how
can
she
have
come
here
she
must
have
hidden
here
and
not
slept
all
he
began
questioning
her
the
child
suddenly
becoming
animated
chattered
away
in
her
baby
language
something
about
mammy
and
that
mammy
would
beat
her
and
about
some
cup
that
she
had
the
child
chattered
on
without
stopping
he
could
only
guess
from
what
she
said
that
she
wa
a
neglected
child
whose
mother
probably
a
drunken
cook
in
the
service
of
the
hotel
whipped
and
frightened
her
that
the
child
had
broken
a
cup
of
her
mother
s
and
wa
so
frightened
that
she
had
run
away
the
evening
before
had
hidden
for
a
long
while
somewhere
outside
in
the
rain
at
last
had
made
her
way
in
here
hidden
behind
the
cupboard
and
spent
the
night
there
cry
and
trembling
from
the
damp
the
darkness
and
the
fear
that
she
would
be
badly
beaten
for
it
he
took
her
in
his
arm
went
back
to
his
room
sat
her
on
the
bed
and
began
undressing
her
the
torn
shoe
which
she
had
on
her
stockingless
foot
were
a
wet
a
if
they
had
been
standing
in
a
puddle
all
night
when
he
had
undressed
her
he
put
her
on
the
bed
covered
her
up
and
wrapped
her
in
the
blanket
from
her
head
downwards
she
fell
asleep
at
once
then
he
sank
into
dreary
musing
again
what
folly
to
trouble
myself
he
decided
suddenly
with
an
oppressive
feeling
of
annoyance
what
idiocy
in
vexation
he
took
up
the
candle
to
go
and
look
for
the
ragged
attendant
again
and
make
haste
to
go
away
damn
the
child
he
thought
a
he
opened
the
door
but
he
turned
again
to
see
whether
the
child
wa
asleep
he
raised
the
blanket
carefully
the
child
wa
sleeping
soundly
she
had
got
warm
under
the
blanket
and
her
pale
cheek
were
flushed
but
strange
to
say
that
flush
seemed
brighter
and
coarser
than
the
rosy
cheek
of
childhood
it
s
a
flush
of
fever
thought
svidrigaïlov
it
wa
like
the
flush
from
drinking
a
though
she
had
been
given
a
full
glass
to
drink
her
crimson
lip
were
hot
and
glowing
but
what
wa
this
he
suddenly
fancied
that
her
long
black
eyelash
were
quivering
a
though
the
lid
were
opening
and
a
sly
crafty
eye
peeped
out
with
an
unchildlike
wink
a
though
the
little
girl
were
not
asleep
but
pretending
yes
it
wa
so
her
lip
parted
in
a
smile
the
corner
of
her
mouth
quivered
a
though
she
were
trying
to
control
them
but
now
she
quite
gave
up
all
effort
now
it
wa
a
grin
a
broad
grin
there
wa
something
shameless
provocative
in
that
quite
unchildish
face
it
wa
depravity
it
wa
the
face
of
a
harlot
the
shameless
face
of
a
french
harlot
now
both
eye
opened
wide
they
turned
a
glowing
shameless
glance
upon
him
they
laughed
invited
him
there
wa
something
infinitely
hideous
and
shocking
in
that
laugh
in
those
eye
in
such
nastiness
in
the
face
of
a
child
what
at
five
year
old
svidrigaïlov
muttered
in
genuine
horror
what
doe
it
mean
and
now
she
turned
to
him
her
little
face
all
aglow
holding
out
her
arm
accursed
child
svidrigaïlov
cried
raising
his
hand
to
strike
her
but
at
that
moment
he
woke
up
he
wa
in
the
same
bed
still
wrapped
in
the
blanket
the
candle
had
not
been
lighted
and
daylight
wa
streaming
in
at
the
window
i
ve
had
nightmare
all
night
he
got
up
angrily
feeling
utterly
shattered
his
bone
ached
there
wa
a
thick
mist
outside
and
he
could
see
nothing
it
wa
nearly
five
he
had
overslept
himself
he
got
up
put
on
his
still
damp
jacket
and
overcoat
feeling
the
revolver
in
his
pocket
he
took
it
out
and
then
he
sat
down
took
a
notebook
out
of
his
pocket
and
in
the
most
conspicuous
place
on
the
title
page
wrote
a
few
line
in
large
letter
reading
them
over
he
sank
into
thought
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
the
revolver
and
the
notebook
lay
beside
him
some
fly
woke
up
and
settled
on
the
untouched
veal
which
wa
still
on
the
table
he
stared
at
them
and
at
last
with
his
free
right
hand
began
trying
to
catch
one
he
tried
till
he
wa
tired
but
could
not
catch
it
at
last
realising
that
he
wa
engaged
in
this
interesting
pursuit
he
started
got
up
and
walked
resolutely
out
of
the
room
a
minute
later
he
wa
in
the
street
a
thick
milky
mist
hung
over
the
town
svidrigaïlov
walked
along
the
slippery
dirty
wooden
pavement
towards
the
little
neva
he
wa
picturing
the
water
of
the
little
neva
swollen
in
the
night
petrovsky
island
the
wet
path
the
wet
grass
the
wet
tree
and
bush
and
at
last
the
bush
he
began
staring
at
the
house
trying
to
think
of
something
else
there
wa
not
a
cabman
or
a
in
the
street
the
bright
yellow
wooden
little
house
looked
dirty
and
dejected
with
their
closed
shutter
the
cold
and
damp
penetrated
his
whole
body
and
he
began
to
shiver
from
time
to
time
he
came
across
shop
sign
and
read
each
carefully
at
last
he
reached
the
end
of
the
wooden
pavement
and
came
to
a
big
stone
house
a
dirty
shivering
dog
crossed
his
path
with
it
tail
between
it
leg
a
man
in
a
greatcoat
lay
face
downwards
dead
drunk
across
the
pavement
he
looked
at
him
and
went
on
a
high
tower
stood
up
on
the
left
bah
he
shouted
here
is
a
place
why
should
it
be
petrovsky
it
will
be
in
the
presence
of
an
official
witness
anyway
he
almost
smiled
at
this
new
thought
and
turned
into
the
street
where
there
wa
the
big
house
with
the
tower
at
the
great
closed
gate
of
the
house
a
little
man
stood
with
his
shoulder
leaning
against
them
wrapped
in
a
grey
soldier
s
coat
with
a
copper
achilles
helmet
on
his
head
he
cast
a
drowsy
and
indifferent
glance
at
svidrigaïlov
his
face
wore
that
perpetual
look
of
peevish
dejection
which
is
so
sourly
printed
on
all
face
of
jewish
race
without
exception
they
both
svidrigaïlov
and
achilles
stared
at
each
other
for
a
few
minute
without
speaking
at
last
it
struck
achilles
a
irregular
for
a
man
not
drunk
to
be
standing
three
step
from
him
staring
and
not
saying
a
word
what
do
you
want
here
he
said
without
moving
or
changing
his
position
nothing
brother
good
morning
answered
svidrigaïlov
this
isn
t
the

part
to
foreign
part
to
svidrigaïlov
took
out
the
revolver
and
cocked
it
achilles
raised
his
eyebrow
i
say
this
is
not
the
place
for
such
joke
why
shouldn
t
it
be
the
place
because
it
isn
well
brother
i
don
t
mind
that

said
to

put
the
revolver

his
right
temple

it
here

cried
achilles
rousing
himself
his
eye
growing
bigger
and
bigger
svidrigaïlov
pulled

up
from

raskolnikov
walked
with
lagging
step
a
though
still
hesitating
whether
to
go
or
not
but
nothing
would
have
turned
him
back
his
decision
wa
taken
besides
it
doesn
t
matter
they
still
know
nothing
he
thought
and
they
are
used
to
thinking
of
me
a
he
wa
appallingly
dressed
his
clothes
torn
and
dirty
soaked
with
a
night
s
rain
his
face
wa
almost
distorted
from
fatigue
exposure
the
inward
conflict
that
had
lasted
for
hour
he
had
spent
all
the
previous
night
alone
god
know
where
but
anyway
he
had
reached
a
decision
he
knocked
at
the
door
which
wa
opened
by
his
mother
dounia
wa
not
at
home
even
the

to
be
out
at
first
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
speechless
with
joy
and
surprise
then
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
into
the
room
here
you
are
she
began
faltering
with
joy
don
t
be
angry
with
me
rodya
for
welcoming
you
so
foolishly
with
tear
i
am
laughing
not
cry
did
you
think
i
wa
cry
no
i
am
delighted
but
i
ve
got
into
such
a
stupid
habit
of
shedding
tear
i
ve
been
like
that
ever
since
your
father
s
death
i
cry
for
anything
sit
down
dear
boy
you
must
be
tired
i
see
you

ah
how
muddy

wa
in
the
rain
yesterday
mother
raskolnikov
began
no
no
pulcheria
alexandrovna
hurriedly
interrupted
you
thought
i
wa
going
to
you
in
the
womanish
way
i
used
to
don
t
be
anxious
i
understand
i
understand
it
all
now
i
ve
learned
the
way
here
and
truly
i
see
for
myself
that
they
are
better
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
once
for
all
how
could
i
understand
your
plan
and
expect
you
to
give
an
account
of
them
god
know
what
concern
and
plan
you
may
have
or
what
idea
you
are
hatching
so
it
s
not
for
me
to
keep
nudging
your
elbow
asking
you
what
you
are
thinking
about
but
my
goodness
why
am
i
running
to
and
fro
a
though
i
were
crazy
i
am
reading
your
article
in
the
magazine
for
the
third
time
rodya
dmitri
prokofitch
brought
it
to
me
directly
i
saw
it
i
cried
out
to
myself
there
foolish
one
i
thought
that
s
what
he
is
busy
about
that
s
the
solution
of
the
mystery
learned
people
are
always
like
that
he
may
have
some
new
idea
in
his
head
just
now
he
is
thinking
them
over
and
i
worry
him
and
upset
i
read
it
my
dear
and
of
course
there
wa
a
great
deal
i
did
not
understand
but
that
s
only
natural
how
should
i
show
me
raskolnikov
took
the
magazine
and
glanced
at
his
article
incongruous
a
it
wa
with
his
mood
and
his
circumstance
he
felt
that
strange
and
bitter
sweet
sensation
that
every
author
experience
the
first
time
he
see
himself
in
print
besides
he
wa
only
it
lasted
only
a
moment
after
reading
a
few
line
he
frowned
and
his
heart
throbbed
with
anguish
he
recalled
all
the
inward
conflict
of
the
preceding
month
he
flung
the
article
on
the
table
with
disgust
and
anger
but
however
foolish
i
may
be
rodya
i
can
see
for
myself
that
you
will
very
soon
be
one
of
the
leading
if
not
the
leading
man
in
the
world
of
russian
thought
and
they
dared
to
think
you
were
mad
you
don
t
know
but
they
really
thought
that
ah
the
despicable
creature
how
could
they
understand
genius
and
dounia
dounia
wa
all
but
believing
it
what
do
you
say
to
that
your
father
sent
twice
to
magazine
the
first
time
poem
i
ve
got
the
manuscript
and
will
show
you
and
the
second
time
a
whole
novel
i
begged
him
to
let
me
copy
it
out
and
how
we
prayed
that
they
should
be
taken

my
heart

any
position
you

your
intellect
and
talent
no
doubt
you
don
t
care
about
that
for
the
present
and
you
are
occupied
with
much
more
important
matter

fullness
of
his
heart

not

but

yes
he
wa
glad

wa
very
glad
that
there
wa
no
one
there
that
he
wa
alone
with
his
mother
for
the
first
time
after
all
those
awful
month
his
heart
wa
softened
he
fell
down
before
her
he
kissed
her
foot
and
both
wept
embracing
and
she
wa
not
surprised
and
did
not
question
him
this
time
for
some
day
she
had
realised
that
something
awful
wa
happening
to
her
son
and
that
now
some
terrible
minute
had
come
for
him
rodya
my
darling
my
first
born
she
said
sobbing
now
you
are
just
a
when
you
were
little
you
would
run
like
this
to
me
and
hug
me
and
kiss
me
when
your
father
wa
living
and
we
were
poor
you
comforted
u
simply
by
being
with
u
and
when
i
buried
your
father
how
often
we
wept
together
at
his
grave
and
embraced
a
now
and
if
i
ve
been
cry
lately
it
s
that
my
mother
s
heart
had
a
foreboding
of
trouble
the
first
time
i
saw
you
that
evening
you
remember
a
soon
a
we
arrived
here
i
guessed
simply
from
your
eye
my
heart
sank
at
once
and
when
i
opened
the
door
and
looked
at
you
i
thought
the
fatal
hour
had
come
rodya
rodya
you
are
not
going
away
no
you
ll
come
again
yes
i
ll
rodya
don
t
be
angry
i
don
t
dare
to
question
you
i
know
i
mustn
t
only
say
two
word
to
me
is
it
far
where
you
are
going
very
what
is
awaiting
you
there
some
post
or
career
for
you
what
god
sends
only
pray
for
raskolnikov
went
to
the
door
but
she
clutched
him
and
gazed
despairingly
into
his
eye
her
face
worked
with
terror
enough
mother
said
raskolnikov
deeply
regretting
that
he
had
come
not
for
ever
it
s
not
yet
for
ever
you
ll
come
you
ll
come
i
will
i
will
he
tore
himself
away
at
last
it
wa
a
warm
fresh
bright
evening
it
had
cleared
up
in
the
morning
raskolnikov
went
to
his
lodging
he
made
haste
he
wanted
to
finish
all
before
sunset
he
did
not
want
to
meet
anyone
till
then
going
up
the
stair
he
noticed
that
nastasya
rushed
from
the
samovar
to
watch
him
intently
can
anyone
have
come
to
see
me
he
wondered
he
had
a
disgusted
vision
of
porfiry
but
opening
his
door
he
saw
dounia
she
wa
sitting
alone
plunged
in
deep
thought
and
looked
a
though
she
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
he
stopped
short
in
the
doorway
she
rose
from
the
sofa
in
dismay
and
stood
up
facing
him
her
eye
fixed
upon
him
betrayed
horror
and
infinite
grief
and
from
those
eye
alone
he
saw
at
once
that
she
knew
am
i
to
come
in
or
go
away
he
asked
uncertainly
i
ve
been
all
day
with
sofya
semyonovna
we
were
both
waiting
for
you
we
thought
that
you
would
be
sure
to
come
raskolnikov
went
into
the
room
and
sank
exhausted
on
a
chair
i
feel
weak
dounia
i
am
very
tired
and
i
should
have
liked
at
this
moment
to
be
able
to
control
he
glanced
at
her
mistrustfully
where
were
you
all
night
i
don
t
remember
clearly
you
see
sister
i
wanted
to
make
up
my
mind
once
for
all
and
several
time
i
walked
by
the
neva
i
remember
that
i
wanted
to
end
it
all
there
but
i
couldn
t
make
up
my
mind
he
whispered
looking
at
her
mistrustfully
again
thank
god
that
wa
just
what
we
were
afraid
of
sofya
semyonovna
and
i
then
you
still
have
faith
in
life
thank
god
thank
god
raskolnikov
smiled
bitterly
i
haven
t
faith
but
i
have
just
been
weeping
in
mother
s
arm
i
haven
t
faith
but
i
have
just
asked
her
to
pray
for
me
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
dounia
i
don
t
understand
have
you
been
at
mother
s
have
you
told
her
cried
dounia
surely
you
haven
t
done
that
no
i
didn
t
tell
her
in
word
but
she
understood
a
great
deal
she
heard
you
talking
in
your
sleep
i
am
sure
she
half
understands
it
already
perhaps
i
did
wrong
in
going
to
see
her
i
don
t
know
why
i
did
go
i
am
a
contemptible
person
a
contemptible
person
but
ready
to
face
suffering
you
are
aren
t
you
yes
i
am
going
at
once
yes
to
escape
the
disgrace
i
thought
of
drowning
myself
dounia
but
a
i
looked
into
the
water
i
thought
that
if
i
had
considered
myself
strong
till
now
i
d
better
not
be
afraid
of
disgrace
he
said
hurrying
on
it
s
pride
pride
there
wa
a
gleam
of
fire
in
his
lustreless
eye
he
seemed
to
be
glad
to
think
that
he
wa
still
proud
you
don
t
think
sister
that
i
wa
simply
afraid
of
the
water
he
asked
looking
into
her
face
with
a
sinister
smile
oh
rodya
hush
cried
dounia
bitterly
silence
lasted
for
two
minute
he
sat
with
his
eye
fixed
on
the
floor
dounia
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
and
looked
at
him
with
anguish
suddenly
he
got
up
it
s
late
it
s
time
to
go
i
am
going
at
once
to
give
myself
up
but
i
don
t
know
why
i
am
going
to
give
myself
big
tear
fell
down
her
cheek
you
are
cry
sister
but
can
you
hold
out
your
hand
to
me
you
doubted
it
she
threw
her
arm
round
him
aren
t
you
half
expiating
your
crime
by
facing
the
suffering
she
cried
holding
him
close
and
kissing
him
crime
what
crime
he
cried
in
sudden
fury
that
i
killed
a
vile
noxious
insect
an
old
pawnbroker
woman
of
use
to
no
one
killing
her
wa
atonement
for
forty
sin
she
wa
sucking
the
life
out
of
poor
people
wa
that
a
crime
i
am
not
thinking
of
it
and
i
am
not
thinking
of
expiating
it
and
why
are
you
all
rubbing
it
in
on
all
side
a
crime
a
crime
only
now
i
see
clearly
the
imbecility
of
my
cowardice
now
that
i
have
decided
to
face
this
superfluous
disgrace
it
s
simply
because
i
am
contemptible
and
have
nothing
in
me
that
i
have
decided
to
perhaps
too
for
my
advantage
a
that
porfiry
suggested
brother
brother
what
are
you
saying
why
you
have
shed
blood
cried
dounia
in
despair
which
all
men
shed
he
put
in
almost
frantically
which
flow
and
ha
always
flowed
in
stream
which
is
spilt
like
champagne
and
for
which
men
are
crowned
in
the
capitol
and
are
called
afterwards
benefactor
of
mankind
look
into
it
more
carefully
and
understand
it
i
too
wanted
to
do
good
to
men
and
would
have
done
hundred
thousand
of
good
deed
to
make
up
for
that
one
piece
of
stupidity
not
stupidity
even
simply
clumsiness
for
the
idea
wa
by
no
mean
so
stupid
a
it
seems
now
that
it
ha
failed
everything
seems
stupid
when
it
fails
by
that
stupidity
i
only
wanted
to
put
myself
into
an
independent
position
to
take
the
first
step
to
obtain
mean
and
then
everything
would
have
been
smoothed
over
by
benefit
immeasurable
in
comparison
but
i
i
couldn
t
carry
out
even
the
first
step
because
i
am
contemptible
that
s
what
s
the
matter
and
yet
i
won
t
look
at
it
a
you
do
if
i
had
succeeded
i
should
have
been
crowned
with
glory
but
now
i
m
but
that
s
not
so
not
so
brother
what
are
you
saying
ah
it
s
not
picturesque
not
æsthetically
attractive
i
fail
to
understand
why
bombarding
people
by
regular
siege
is
more
honourable
the
fear
of
appearance
is
the
first
symptom
of
impotence
i
ve
never
never
recognised
this
more
clearly
than
now
and
i
am
further
than
ever
from
seeing
that
what
i
did
wa
a
crime
i
ve
never
never
been
stronger
and
more
convinced
than
the
colour
had
rushed
into
his
pale
exhausted
face
but
a
he
uttered
his
last
explanation
he
happened
to
meet
dounia
s
eye
and
he
saw
such
anguish
in
them
that
he
could
not
help
being
checked
he
felt
that
he
had
anyway
made
these
two
poor
woman
miserable
that
he
wa
anyway
the
cause
dounia
darling
if
i
am
guilty
forgive
me
though
i
can
not
be
forgiven
if
i
am
guilty
we
won
t
dispute
it
s
time
high
time
to
go
don
t
follow
me
i
beseech
you
i
have
somewhere
else
to
go
but
you
go
at
once
and
sit
with
mother
i
entreat
you
to
it
s
my
last
request
of
you
don
t
leave
her
at
all
i
left
her
in
a
state
of
anxiety
that
she
is
not
fit
to
bear
she
will
die
or
go
out
of
her
mind
be
with
her
razumihin
will
be
with
you
i
ve
been
talking
to
him
don
t
cry
about
me
i
ll
try
to
be
honest
and
manly
all
my
life
even
if
i
am
a
murderer
perhaps
i
shall
some
day
make
a
name
i
won
t
disgrace
you
you
will
see
i
ll
still
show
now
for
the
present
he
concluded
hurriedly
noticing
again
a
strange
expression
in
dounia
s
eye
at
his
last
word
and
promise
why
are
you
cry
don
t
cry
don
t
cry
we
are
not
parting
for
ever
ah
yes
wait
a
minute
i
d
forgotten
he
went
to
the
table
took
up
a
thick
dusty
book
opened
it
and
took
from
between
the
page
a
little
portrait
on
ivory
it
wa
the
portrait
of
his
landlady
s
daughter
who
had
died
of
fever
that
strange
girl
who
had
wanted
to
be
a
nun
for
a
minute
he
gazed
at
the
delicate
expressive
face
of
his
betrothed
kissed
the
portrait
and
gave
it
to
dounia
i
used
to
talk
a
great
deal
about
it
to
her
only
to
her
he
said
thoughtfully
to
her
heart
i
confided
much
of
what
ha
since
been
so
hideously
realised
don
t
be
uneasy
he
returned
to
dounia
she
wa
a
much
opposed
to
it
a
you
and
i
am
glad
that
she
is
gone
the
great
point
is
that
everything
now
is
going
to
be
different
is
going
to
be
broken
in
two
he
cried
suddenly
returning
to
his
dejection
everything
everything
and
am
i
prepared
for
it
do
i
want
it
myself
they
say
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
suffer
what
s
the
object
of
these
senseless
suffering
shall
i
know
any
better
what
they
are
for
when
i
am
crushed
by
hardship
and
idiocy
and
weak
a
an
old
man
after
twenty
year
penal
servitude
and
what
shall
i
have
to
live
for
then
why
am
i
consenting
to
that
life
now
oh
i
knew
i
wa
contemptible
when
i
stood
looking
at
the
neva
at
daybreak
at
last
they
both
went
out
it
wa
hard
for
dounia
but
she
loved
him
she
walked
away
but
after
going
fifty
pace
she
turned
round
to
look
at
him
again
he
wa
still
in
sight
at
the
corner
he
too
turned
and
for
the
last
time
their
eye
met
but
noticing
that
she
wa
looking
at
him
he
motioned
her
away
with
impatience
and
even
vexation
and
turned
the
corner
abruptly
i
am
wicked
i
see
that
he
thought
to
himself
feeling
ashamed
a
moment
later
of
his
angry
gesture
to
dounia
but
why
are
they
so
fond
of
me
if
i
don
t
deserve
it
oh
if
only
i
were
alone
and
no
one
loved
me
and
i
too
had
never
loved
anyone
of
all
this
would
have
but
i
wonder
shall
i
in
those
fifteen
or
twenty
year
grow
so
meek
that
i
shall
humble
myself
before
people
and
whimper
at
every
word
that
i
am
a
criminal
yes
that
s
it
that
s
it
that
s
what
they
are
sending
me
there
for
that
s
what
they
want
look
at
them
running
to
and
fro
about
the
street
every
one
of
them
a
scoundrel
and
a
criminal
at
heart
and
worse
still
an
idiot
but
try
to
get
me
off
and
they
d
be
wild
with
righteous
indignation
oh
how
i
hate
them
all
he
fell
to
musing
by
what
process
it
could
come
to
pas
that
he
could
be
humbled
before
all
of
them
indiscriminately
humbled
by
conviction
and
yet
why
not
it
must
be
so
would
not
twenty
year
of
continual
bondage
crush
him
utterly
water
wear
out
a
stone
and
why
why
should
he
live
after
that
why
should
he
go
now
when
he
knew
that
it
would
be
so
it
wa
the
hundredth
time
perhaps
that
he
had
asked
himself
that
question
since
the
previous
evening
but
still
he
went
chapter
viii
when
he
went
into
sonia
s
room
it
wa
already
getting
dark
all
day
sonia
had
been
waiting
for
him
in
terrible
anxiety
dounia
had
been
waiting
with
her
she
had
come
to
her
that
morning
remembering
svidrigaïlov
s
word
that
sonia
knew
we
will
not
describe
the
conversation
and
tear
of
the
two
girl
and
how
friendly
they
became
dounia
gained
one
comfort
at
least
from
that
interview
that
her
brother
would
not
be
alone
he
had
gone
to
her
sonia
first
with
his
confession
he
had
gone
to
her
for
human
fellowship
when
he
needed
it
she
would
go
with
him
wherever
fate
might
send
him
dounia
did
not
ask
but
she
knew
it
wa
so
she
looked
at
sonia
almost
with
reverence
and
at
first
almost
embarrassed
her
by
it
sonia
wa
almost
on
the
point
of
tear
she
felt
herself
on
the
contrary
hardly
worthy
to
look
at
dounia
dounia
s
gracious
image
when
she
had
bowed
to
her
so
attentively
and
respectfully
at
their
first
meeting
in
raskolnikov
s
room
had
remained
in
her
mind
a
one
of
the
fairest
vision
of
her
life
dounia
at
last
became
impatient
and
leaving
sonia
went
to
her
brother
s
room
to
await
him
there
she
kept
thinking
that
he
would
come
there
first
when
she
had
gone
sonia
began
to
be
tortured
by
the
dread
of
his
committing
suicide
and
dounia
too
feared
it
but
they
had
spent
the
day
trying
to
persuade
each
other
that
that
could
not
be
and
both
were
less
anxious
while
they
were
together
a
soon
a
they
parted
each
thought
of
nothing
else
sonia
remembered
how
svidrigaïlov
had
said
to
her
the
day
before
that
raskolnikov
had
two
alternative
siberia
or
besides
she
knew
his
vanity
his
pride
and
his
lack
of
faith
is
it
possible
that
he
ha
nothing
but
cowardice
and
fear
of
death
to
make
him
live
she
thought
at
last
in
despair
meanwhile
the
sun
wa
setting
sonia
wa
standing
in
dejection
looking
intently
out
of
the
window
but
from
it
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
unwhitewashed
blank
wall
of
the
next
house
at
last
when
she
began
to
feel
sure
of
his
death
he
walked
into
the
room
she
gave
a
cry
of
joy
but
looking
carefully
into
his
face
she
turned
pale
yes
said
raskolnikov
smiling
i
have
come
for
your
cross
sonia
it
wa
you
told
me
to
go
to
the
why
is
it
you
are
frightened
now
it
s
come
to
that
sonia
gazed
at
him
astonished
his
tone
seemed
strange
to
her
a
cold
shiver
ran
over
her
but
in
a
moment
she
guessed
that
the
tone
and
the
word
were
a
mask
he
spoke
to
her
looking
away
a
though
to
avoid
meeting
her
eye
you
see
sonia
i
ve
decided
that
it
will
be
better
so
there
is
one
fact
but
it
s
a
long
story
and
there
s
no
need
to
discus
it
but
do
you
know
what
anger
me
it
annoys
me
that
all
those
stupid
brutish
face
will
be
gaping
at
me
directly
pestering
me
with
their
stupid
question
which
i
shall
have
to
answer
they
ll
point
their
finger
at
me
tfoo
you
know
i
am
not
going
to
porfiry
i
am
sick
of
him
i
d
rather
go
to
my
friend
the
explosive
lieutenant
how
i
shall
surprise
him
what
a
sensation
i
shall
make
but
i
must
be
cooler
i
ve
become
too
irritable
of
late
you
know
i
wa
nearly
shaking
my
fist
at
my
sister
just
now
because
she
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
me
it
s
a
brutal
state
to
be
in
ah
what
am
i
coming
to
well
where
are
the
cross
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
what
he
wa
doing
he
could
not
stay
still
or
concentrate
his
attention
on
anything
his
idea
seemed
to
gallop
after
one
another
he
talked
incoherently
his
hand
trembled
slightly
without
a
word
sonia
took
out
of
the
drawer
two
cross
one
of
cypress
wood
and
one
of
copper
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
herself
and
over
him
and
put
the
wooden
cross
on
his
neck
it
s
the
symbol
of
my
taking
up
the
cross
he
laughed
a
though
i
had
not
suffered
much
till
now
the
wooden
cross
that
is
the
peasant
one
the
copper
one
that
is
lizaveta
s
you
will
wear
yourself
show
me
so
she
had
it
on
at
that
moment
i
remember
two
thing
like
these
too
a
silver
one
and
a
little
ikon
i
threw
them
back
on
the
old
woman
s
neck
those
would
be
appropriate
now
really
those
are
what
i
ought
to
put
on
now
but
i
am
talking
nonsense
and
forgetting
what
matter
i
m
somehow
forgetful
you
see
i
have
come
to
warn
you
sonia
so
that
you
might
know
that
s
all
that
s
all
i
came
for
but
i
thought
i
had
more
to
say
you
wanted
me
to
go
yourself
well
now
i
am
going
to
prison
and
you
ll
have
your
wish
well
what
are
you
cry
for
you
too
don
t
leave
off
oh
how
i
hate
it
all
but
his
feeling
wa
stirred
his
heart
ached
a
he
looked
at
her
why
is
she
grieving
too
he
thought
to
himself
what
am
i
to
her
why
doe
she
weep
why
is
she
looking
after
me
like
my
mother
or
dounia
she
ll
be
my
cross
yourself
say
at
least
one
prayer
sonia
begged
in
a
timid
broken
voice
oh
certainly
a
much
a
you
like
and
sincerely
sonia
sincerely
but
he
wanted
to
say
something
quite
different
he
crossed
himself
several
time
sonia
took
up
her
shawl
and
put
it
over
her
head
it
wa
the
green
de
shawl
of
which
marmeladov
had
spoken
the
family
raskolnikov
thought
of
that
looking
at
it
but
he
did
not
ask
he
began
to
feel
himself
that
he
wa
certainly
forgetting
thing
and
wa
disgustingly
agitated
he
wa
frightened
at
this
he
wa
suddenly
struck
too
by
the
thought
that
sonia
meant
to
go
with
him
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
going
stay
here
stay
i
ll
go
alone
he
cried
in
cowardly
vexation
and
almost
resentful
he
moved
towards
the
door
what
s
the
use
of
going
in
procession
he
muttered
going
out
sonia
remained
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
had
not
even
said
to
her
he
had
forgotten
her
a
poignant
and
rebellious
doubt
surged
in
his
heart
wa
it
right
wa
it
right
all
this
he
thought
again
a
he
went
down
the
stair
couldn
t
he
stop
and
retract
it
all
and
not
go
but
still
he
went
he
felt
suddenly
once
for
all
that
he
mustn
t
ask
himself
question
a
he
turned
into
the
street
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
said
to
sonia
that
he
had
left
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
her
green
shawl
not
daring
to
stir
after
he
had
shouted
at
her
and
he
stopped
short
for
a
moment
at
the
same
instant
another
thought
dawned
upon
him
a
though
it
had
been
lying
in
wait
to
strike
him
then
why
with
what
object
did
i
go
to
her
just
now
i
told
her
on
business
on
what
business
i
had
no
sort
of
business
to
tell
her
i
wa
but
where
wa
the
need
do
i
love
her
no
no
i
drove
her
away
just
now
like
a
dog
did
i
want
her
cross
oh
how
low
i
ve
sunk
no
i
wanted
her
tear
i
wanted
to
see
her
terror
to
see
how
her
heart
ached
i
had
to
have
something
to
cling
to
something
to
delay
me
some
friendly
face
to
see
and
i
dared
to
believe
in
myself
to
dream
of
what
i
would
do
i
am
a
beggarly
contemptible
wretch
contemptible
he
walked
along
the
canal
bank
and
he
had
not
much
further
to
go
but
on
reaching
the
bridge
he
stopped
and
turning
out
of
his
way
along
it
went
to
the
hay
market
he
looked
eagerly
to
right
and
left
gazed
intently
at
every
object
and
could
not
fix
his
attention
on
anything
everything
slipped
away
in
another
week
another
month
i
shall
be
driven
in
a
prison
van
over
this
bridge
how
shall
i
look
at
the
canal
then
i
should
like
to
remember
this
slipped
into
his
mind
look
at
this
sign
how
shall
i
read
those
letter
then
it
s
written
here
campany
that
s
a
thing
to
remember
that
letter
and
to
look
at
it
again
in
a
month
how
shall
i
look
at
it
then
what
shall
i
be
feeling
and
thinking
then
how
trivial
it
all
must
be
what
i
am
fretting
about
now
of
course
it
must
all
be
interesting
in
it
way
what
am
i
thinking
about
i
am
becoming
a
baby
i
am
showing
off
to
myself
why
am
i
ashamed
foo
how

fat
man

german

must
be
who
pushed
against
me
doe
he

whom

pushed
there
s
a
peasant
woman
with
a
baby
begging
it
s
curious
that
she
think
me
happier
than
she
is
i
might
give
her
something
for
the
incongruity
of
it

in
my
pocket

the
beggar
chanted
in
a
lachrymose
voice
he
went
into
the
hay
market
it
wa
distasteful
very
distasteful
to
be
in
a
crowd
but
he
walked
just
where
he
saw
most
people
he
would
have
given
anything
in
the
world
to
be
alone
but
he
knew
himself
that
he
would
not
have
remained
alone
for
a
moment
there
wa
a
man
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
crowd
he
kept
trying
to
dance
and
falling
down
there
wa
a
ring
round
him
raskolnikov
squeezed
his
way
through
the
crowd
stared
for
some
minute
at
the
drunken
man
and
suddenly
gave
a
short
jerky
laugh
a
minute
later
he
had
forgotten
him
and
did
not
see
him
though
he
still
stared
he
moved
away
at
last
not
remembering
where
he
wa
but
when
he
got
into
the
middle
of
the
square
an
emotion
suddenly
came
over
him
overwhelming
him
body
and
mind
he
suddenly
recalled
sonia
s
word
go
to
the
bow
down
to
the
people
kiss
the
earth
for
you
have
sinned
against
it
too
and
say
aloud

he
trembled
remembering
that
and
the
hopeless
misery
and
anxiety
of
all
that
time
especially
of
the
last
hour
had
weighed
so
heavily
upon
him
that
he
positively
clutched
at
the
chance
of
this
new
unmixed
complete
sensation
it
came
over
him
like
a
fit
it
wa
like
a
single
spark
kindled
in
his
soul
and
spreading
fire
through
him
everything
in
him
softened
at
once
and
the
tear
started
into
his
eye
he
fell
to
the
earth
on
the
spot
he
knelt
down
in
the
middle
of
the
square
bowed
down
to
the
earth
and
kissed
that
filthy
earth
with
bliss
and
rapture
he
got
up
and
bowed
down
a
second
time
he
s
boozed
a
youth
near
him
observed
there
wa
a
roar
of
laughter
he
s
going
to
jerusalem
brother
and
saying
to
his
child
and
his
country
he
s
bowing
down
to
all
the
world
and
kissing
the
great
city
of
petersburg
and
it
pavement
added
a
workman
who
wa
a
little
drunk
quite
a
young
man
too
observed
a
third
and
a
gentleman
someone
observed
soberly
there
s
no
knowing
who
s
a
gentleman
and
who
isn
t
these
exclamation
and
remark
checked
raskolnikov
and
the
word
i
am
a
murderer
which
were
perhaps
on
the
point
of
dropping
from
his
lip
died
away
he
bore
these
remark
quietly
however
and
without
looking
round
he
turned
down
a
street
leading
to
the
police
office
he
had
a
glimpse
of
something
on
the
way
which
did
not
surprise
him
he
had
felt
that
it
must
be
so
the
second
time
he
bowed
down
in
the
hay
market
he
saw
standing
fifty
pace
from
him
on
the
left
sonia
she
wa
hiding
from
him
behind
one
of
the
wooden
shanty
in
the
she
had
followed
him
then
on
his
painful
way
raskolnikov
at
that
moment
felt
and
knew
once
for
all
that
sonia
wa
with
him
for
ever
and
would
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
earth
wherever
fate
might
take
him
it
wrung
his
heart
but
he
wa
just
reaching
the
fatal
place
he
went
into
the
yard
fairly
resolutely
he
had
to
mount
to
the
third
storey
i
shall
be
some
time
going
up
he
thought
he
felt
a
though
the
fateful
moment
wa
still
far
off
a
though
he
had
plenty
of
time
left
for
consideration
again
the
same
rubbish
the
same
eggshell
lying
about
on
the
spiral
stair
again
the
open
door
of
the
flat
again
the
same
kitchen
and
the
same
fume
and
stench
coming
from
them
raskolnikov
had
not
been
here
since
that
day
his
leg
were
numb
and
gave
way
under
him
but
still
they
moved
forward
he
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
breath
to
collect
himself
so
a
to
enter
a
but
why
what
for
he
wondered
reflecting
if
i
must
drink
the
cup
what
difference
doe
it
make
the
more
revolting
the
he
imagined
for
an
instant
the
figure
of
the
explosive
lieutenant
ilya
petrovitch
wa
he
actually
going
to
him
couldn
t
he
go
to
someone
else
to
nikodim
fomitch
couldn
t
he
turn
back
and
go
straight
to
nikodim
fomitch
s
lodging
at
least
then
it
would
be
done
privately
no
no
to
the
explosive
lieutenant
if
he
must
drink
it
drink
it
off
at
once
turning
cold
and
hardly
conscious
he
opened
the
door
of
the
office
there
were
very
few
people
in
it
this
time
only
a
house
porter
and
a
peasant
the
doorkeeper
did
not
even
peep
out
from
behind
his
screen
raskolnikov
walked
into
the
next
room
perhaps
i
still
need
not
speak
passed
through
his
mind
some
sort
of
clerk
not
wearing
a
uniform
wa
settling
himself
at
a
bureau
to
write
in
a
corner
another
clerk
wa
seating
himself
zametov
wa
not
there
nor
of
course
nikodim
fomitch
no
one
in
raskolnikov
asked
addressing
the
person
at
the
bureau
whom
do
you
want
not
a
sound
wa
heard
not
a
sight
wa
seen
but
i
scent
the
russian
how
doe
it
go
on
in
the
fairy
tale
i
ve
forgotten
at
your
service
a
familiar
voice
cried
suddenly
raskolnikov
shuddered
the
explosive
lieutenant
stood
before
him
he
had
just
come
in
from
the
third
room
it
is
the
hand
of
fate
thought
raskolnikov
why
is
he
here
you
ve
come
to
see
u
what
about
cried
ilya
petrovitch
he
wa
obviously
in
an
exceedingly
good
humour
and
perhaps
a
trifle
exhilarated
if
it
s
on
business
you
are
rather
early
it
s
only
a
chance
that
i
am
here
however
i
ll
do
what
i
can
i
must
admit
i
what
is
it
what
is
it
excuse
me
dostoevsky
appears
to
have
forgotten
that
it
is
after
sunset
and
that
the
last
time
raskolnikov
visited
the
police
office
at
two
in
the
afternoon
he
wa
reproached
for
coming
too

i
made
many
inquiry
about
you
i
assure
you
i
ve
been
genuinely
grieved
since
that
since
i
behaved
like
that
it
wa
explained
to
me
afterwards
that
you
were
a
literary
man
and
a
learned
one
too
and
so
to
say
the
first
step
mercy
on
u
what
literary
or
scientific
man
doe
not
begin
by
some
originality
of
conduct
my
wife
and
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
literature
in
my
wife
it
s
a
genuine
passion
literature
and
art
if
only
a
man
is
a
gentleman
all
the
rest
can
be
gained
by
talent
learning
good
sense
genius
a
for
a
hat
well
what
doe
a
hat
matter
i
can
buy
a
hat
a
easily

hat

buy
that
i
wa
even
meaning
to
come
and
apologise
to
you
but
thought
maybe
you
d
but
i
am
forgetting
to
ask
you
is
there
anything
you
want
really
i
hear
your
family
have
come
yes
my
mother
and
i
ve
even
had
the
honour
and
happiness
of
meeting
your
sister
a
highly
cultivated
and
charming
person
i
confess
i
wa
sorry
i
got
so
hot
with
you
there
it
is
but
a
for
my
looking
suspiciously
at
your
fainting
fit
that
affair
ha
been
cleared
up
splendidly
bigotry
and
fanaticism
i
understand
your
indignation
perhaps
you
are
changing
your
lodging
on
account
of
your
family
s
arriving
no
i
only
looked
in
i
came
to
ask
i
thought
that
i
should
find
zametov
oh
yes
of
course
you
ve
made
friend
i
heard
well
no
zametov
is
not
here
yes
we
ve
lost
zametov
he
s
not
been
here
since
yesterday
he
quarrelled
with
everyone
on
leaving
in
the
rudest
way
he
is
a
youngster
that
s
all
one
might
have
expected
something
from
him
but
there
you
know
what
they
are
our
brilliant
young
men
he
wanted
to
go
in
for
some
examination
but
it
s
only
to
talk
and
boast
about
it
it
will
go
no
further
than
that
of
course
it
s
a
very
different
matter
with
you
or
razumihin
there
your
friend
your
career
is
an
intellectual
one
and
you
won
t
be
deterred
by
failure
for
you
one
may
say
all
the
attraction
of
life
you
are
an
ascetic
a
monk
a
hermit
a
book
a
pen
behind
your
ear
a
learned
research
that
s
where
your
spirit
soar
i
am
the
same
way
myself
have
you
read

travel
oh
i
have
there
are
a
great
many
nihilist
about
nowadays
you
know
and
indeed
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
what
sort
of
day
are
they
i
ask
you
but
we
thought
you
are
not
a
nihilist
of
course
answer
me
openly
openly
believe
me
you
can
speak
openly
to
me
a
you
would
to
yourself
official
duty
is
one
thing
but
you
are
thinking
i
meant
to
say
is
quite
another
no
you
re
wrong
it
s
not
friendship
but
the
feeling
of
a
man
and
a
citizen
the
feeling
of
humanity
and
of
love
for
the
almighty
i
may
be
an
official
but
i
am
always
bound
to
feel
myself
a
man
and
a
citizen
you
were
asking
about
zametov
zametov
will
make
a
scandal
in
the
french
style
in
a
house
of
bad
reputation
over
a
glass
of
champagne
that
s
all
your
zametov
is
good
for
while
i
m
perhaps
so
to
speak
burning
with
devotion
and
lofty
feeling
and
besides
i
have
rank
consequence
a
post
i
am
married
and
have
child
i
fulfil
the
duty
of
a
man
and
a
citizen
but
who
is
he
may
i
ask
i
appeal
to
you
a
a
man
ennobled
by
education
then
these
midwife
too
have
become
extraordinarily
raskolnikov
raised
his
eyebrow
inquiringly
the
word
of
ilya
petrovitch
who
had
obviously
been
dining
were
for
the
most
part
a
stream
of
empty
sound
for
him
but
some
of
them
he
understood
he
looked
at
him
inquiringly
not
knowing
how
it
would
end
i
mean
those
wench
the
talkative
ilya
petrovitch
continued
midwife
is
my
name
for
them
i
think
it
a
very
satisfactory
one
they
go
to
the
academy
study
anatomy
if
i
fall
ill
am
i
to
send
for
a
young
lady
to
treat
me
what
do
you
say
ilya
petrovitch
laughed
quite
pleased
with
his
own
wit
it
s
an
immoderate
zeal
for
education
but
once
you
re
educated
that
s
enough
why
abuse
it
why
insult
honourable
people
a
that
scoundrel
zametov
doe
why
did
he
insult
me
i
ask
you
look
at
these
suicide
too
how
common
they
are
you
can
t
fancy
people
spend
their
last
halfpenny
and
kill
themselves
boy
and
girl
and
old
people
only
this
morning
we

about
a
gentleman
who
had
just
come
to
town
nil
pavlitch
i
say
what
wa
the
name
of
that
gentleman
who
shot
himself
svidrigaïlov
someone
answered
from
the
other
room
with
drowsy
listlessness
raskolnikov
started
svidrigaïlov
svidrigaïlov
ha
shot
himself
he
cried

his
wife
wa
a
man
of
reckless
habit
and
all
of
a
sudden
shot
himself
and
in
such
a
shocking
way
he
left
in
his
notebook
a
few
word
that
he
dy
in
full
possession
of
his
faculty
and
that
no
one
is
to
blame
for
his
death
he
had
money
they
say
how
did
you
come
to
know
him
i
wa
acquainted
my
sister
wa
governess
in
his
then
no
doubt
you

no
suspicion
i
saw
him
yesterday
he
wa
drinking
wine

knew
raskolnikov

a
though
something
had
fallen
on
him
and
wa
stifling
him
you
ve
turned
pale
again
it
s
so
stuffy
here

raskolnikov

my
troubling

glad
raskolnikov
smiled
he
went
out
he
reeled
he
wa
overtaken
with
giddiness
and
did
not
know
what
he
wa
doing
he
began
going
down
the
stair
supporting
himself
with
his
right
hand
against
the
wall
he
fancied
that
a
porter
pushed
past
him
on
his
way
upstairs
to
the
police
office
that
a
dog
in
the
lower
storey
kept
up
a
shrill
barking
and
that
a
woman
flung
a
at
it
and
shouted
he
went
down
and
out
into
the
yard
there
not
far
from
the
entrance
stood
sonia
pale
and
she
looked
wildly
at
him
he
stood
still
before
her
there
wa
a
look
of
poignant

his

bank
of
a
broad
solitary
river
stand
a
town
one
of
the
administrative
centre
of
russia
in
the
town
there
is
a
fortress
in
the
fortress
there
is
a
prison
in
the
prison
the
convict
rodion
raskolnikov
ha
been
confined
for
nine
month
almost
a
year
and
a
half
ha
passed
since
his
crime
there
had
been
little
difficulty
about
his
trial
the
criminal
adhered
exactly
firmly
and
clearly
to
his
statement
he
did
not
confuse
nor
misrepresent
the
fact
nor
soften
them
in
his
own
interest
nor
omit
the
smallest
detail
he
explained
every
incident
of
the
murder
the
secret
of
the
piece
of
wood
with
a
strip
of
metal
which
wa
found
in
the
murdered
woman
s
hand
he
described
minutely
how
he
had
taken
her
key
what
they
were
like
a
well
a
the
chest
and
it
content
he
explained
the
mystery
of
lizaveta
s
murder
described
how
koch
and
after
him
the
student
knocked
and
repeated
all
they
had
said
to
one
another
how
he
afterwards
had
run
downstairs
and
heard
nikolay
and
dmitri
shouting
how
he
had
hidden
in
the
empty
flat
and
afterwards
gone
home
he
ended
by
indicating
the
stone
in
the
yard
off
the
voznesensky
prospect
under
which
the
purse
and
the
trinket
were
found
the
whole
thing
in
fact
wa
perfectly
clear
the
lawyer
and
the
judge
were
very
much
struck
among
other
thing
by
the
fact
that
he
had
hidden
the
trinket
and
the
purse
under
a
stone
without
making
use
of
them
and
that
what
wa
more
he
did
not
now
remember
what
the
trinket
were
like
or
even
how
many
there
were
the
fact
that
he
had
never
opened
the
purse
and
did
not
even
know
how
much
wa
in
it
seemed
incredible
there
turned
out
to
be
in
the
purse
three
hundred
and
seventeen
rouble
and
sixty
copeck
from
being
so
long
under
the
stone
some
of
the
most
valuable
note
lying
uppermost
had
suffered
from
the
damp
they
were
a
long
while
trying
to
discover
why
the
accused
man
should
tell
a
lie
about
this
when
about
everything
else
he
had
made
a
truthful
and
straightforward
confession
finally
some
of
the
lawyer
more
versed
in
psychology
admitted
that
it
wa
possible
he
had
really
not
looked
into
the
purse
and
so
didn
t
know
what
wa
in
it
when
he
hid
it
under
the
stone
but
they
immediately
drew
the
deduction
that
the
crime
could
only
have
been
committed
through
temporary
mental
derangement
through
homicidal
mania
without
object
or
the
pursuit
of
gain
this
fell
in
with
the
most
recent
fashionable
theory
of
temporary
insanity
so
often
applied
in
our
day
in
criminal
case
moreover
raskolnikov
s
hypochondriacal
condition
wa
proved
by
many
witness
by
zossimov
his
former
fellow
student
his
landlady
and
her
servant
all
this
pointed
strongly
to
the
conclusion
that
raskolnikov
wa
not
quite
like
an
ordinary
murderer
and
robber
but
that
there
wa
another
element
in
the
case
to
the
intense
annoyance
of
those
who
maintained
this
opinion
the
criminal
scarcely
attempted
to
defend
himself
to
the
decisive
question
a
to
what
motive
impelled
him
to
the
murder
and
the
robbery
he
answered
very
clearly
with
the
coarsest
frankness
that
the
cause
wa
his
miserable
position
his
poverty
and
helplessness
and
his
desire
to
provide
for
his
first
step
in
life
by
the
help
of
the
three
thousand
rouble
he
had
reckoned
on
finding
he
had
been
led
to
the
murder
through
his
shallow
and
cowardly
nature
exasperated
moreover
by
privation
and
failure
to
the
question
what
led
him
to
confess
he
answered
that
it
wa
his
heartfelt
repentance
all
this
wa
almost
coarse
the
sentence
however
wa
more
merciful
than
could
have
been
expected
perhaps
partly
because
the
criminal
had
not
tried
to
justify
himself
but
had
rather
shown
a
desire
to
exaggerate
his
guilt
all
the
strange
and
peculiar
circumstance
of
the
crime
were
taken
into
consideration
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
abnormal
and
condition
of
the
criminal
at
the
time
the
fact
that
he
had
made
no
use
of
what
he
had
stolen
wa
put
down
partly
to
the
effect
of
remorse
partly
to
his
abnormal
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
the
crime
incidentally
the
murder
of
lizaveta
served
indeed
to
confirm
the
last
hypothesis
a
man
commits
two
murder
and
forgets
that
the
door
is
open
finally
the
confession
at
the
very
moment
when
the
case
wa
hopelessly
muddled
by
the
false
evidence
given
by
nikolay
through
melancholy
and
fanaticism
and
when
moreover
there
were
no
proof
against
the
real
criminal
no
suspicion
even
porfiry
petrovitch
fully
kept
his
word
all
this
did
much
to
soften
the
sentence
other
circumstance
too
in
the
prisoner
s
favour
came
out
quite
unexpectedly
razumihin
somehow
discovered
and
proved
that
while
raskolnikov
wa
at
the
university
he
had
helped
a
poor
consumptive
fellow
student
and
had
spent
his
last
penny
on
supporting
him
for
six
month
and
when
this
student
died
leaving
a
decrepit
old
father
whom
he
had
maintained
almost
from
his
thirteenth
year
raskolnikov
had
got
the
old
man
into
a
hospital
and
paid
for
his
funeral
when
he
died
raskolnikov
s
landlady
bore
witness
too
that
when
they
had
lived
in
another
house
at
five
corner
raskolnikov
had
rescued
two
little
child
from
a
house
on
fire
and
wa
burnt
in
doing
so
this
wa
investigated
and
fairly
well
confirmed
by
many
witness
these
fact
made
an
impression
in
his
favour
and
in
the
end
the
criminal
wa
in
consideration
of
extenuating
circumstance
condemned
to
penal
servitude
in
the
second
class
for
a
term
of
eight
year
only
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
raskolnikov
s
mother
fell
dounia
and
razumihin
found
it
possible
to
get
her
out
of
petersburg
during
the
trial
razumihin
chose
a
town
on
the
railway
not
far
from
petersburg
so
a
to
be
able
to
follow
every
step
of
the
trial
and
at
the
same
time
to
see
avdotya
romanovna
a
often
a
possible
pulcheria
alexandrovna
s
illness
wa
a
strange
nervous
one
and
wa
accompanied
by
a
partial
derangement
of
her
intellect
when
dounia
returned
from
her
last
interview
with
her
brother
she
had
found
her
mother
already
ill
in
feverish
delirium
that
evening
razumihin
and
she
agreed
what
answer
they
must
make
to
her
mother
s
question
about
raskolnikov
and
made
up
a
complete
story
for
her
mother
s
benefit
of
his
having
to
go
away
to
a
distant
part
of
russia
on
a
business
commission
which
would
bring
him
in
the
end
money
and
reputation
but
they
were
struck
by
the
fact
that
pulcheria
alexandrovna
never
asked
them
anything
on
the
subject
neither
then
nor
thereafter
on
the
contrary
she
had
her
own
version
of
her
son
s
sudden
departure
she
told
them
with
tear
how
he
had
come
to
say
to
her
hinting
that
she
alone
knew
many
mysterious
and
important
fact
and
that
rodya
had
many
very
powerful
enemy
so
that
it
wa
necessary
for
him
to
be
in
hiding
a
for
his
future
career
she
had
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
brilliant
when
certain
sinister
influence
could
be
removed
she
assured
razumihin
that
her
son
would
be
one
day
a
great
statesman
that
his
article
and
brilliant
literary
talent
proved
it
this
article
she
wa
continually
reading
she
even
read
it
aloud
almost
took
it
to
bed
with
her
but
scarcely
asked
where
rodya
wa
though
the
subject
wa
obviously
avoided
by
the
others
which
might
have
been
enough
to
awaken
her
suspicion
they
began
to
be
frightened
at
last
at
pulcheria
alexandrovna
s
strange
silence
on
certain
subject
she
did
not
for
instance
complain
of
getting
no
letter
from
him
though
in
previous
year
she
had
only
lived
on
the
hope
of
letter
from
her
beloved
rodya
this
wa
the
cause
of
great
uneasiness
to
dounia
the
idea
occurred
to
her
that
her
mother
suspected
that
there
wa
something
terrible
in
her
son
s
fate
and
wa
afraid
to
ask
for
fear
of
hearing
something
still
more
awful
in
any
case
dounia
saw
clearly
that
her
mother
wa
not
in
full
possession
of
her
faculty
it
happened
once
or
twice
however
that
pulcheria
alexandrovna
gave
such
a
turn
to
the
conversation
that
it
wa
impossible
to
answer
her
without
mentioning
where
rodya
wa
and
on
receiving
unsatisfactory
and
suspicious
answer
she
became
at
once
gloomy
and
silent
and
this
mood
lasted
for
a
long
time
dounia
saw
at
last
that
it
wa
hard
to
deceive
her
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
wa
better
to
be
absolutely
silent
on
certain
point
but
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
the
poor
mother
suspected
something
terrible
dounia
remembered
her
brother
s
telling
her
that
her
mother
had
overheard
her
talking
in
her
sleep
on
the
night
after
her
interview
with
svidrigaïlov
and
before
the
fatal
day
of
the
confession
had
not
she
made
out
something
from
that
sometimes
day
and
even
week
of
gloomy
silence
and
tear
would
be
succeeded
by
a
period
of
hysterical
animation
and
the
invalid
would
begin
to
talk
almost
incessantly
of
her
son
of
her
hope
of
his
future
her
fancy
were
sometimes
very
strange
they
humoured
her
pretended
to
agree
with
her
she
saw
perhaps
that
they
were
pretending
but
she
still
went
on
talking
five
month
after
raskolnikov
s
confession
he
wa
sentenced
razumihin
and
sonia
saw
him
in
prison
a
often
a
it
wa
possible
at
last
the
moment
of
separation
came
dounia
swore
to
her
brother
that
the
separation
should
not
be
for
ever
razumihin
did
the
same
razumihin
in
his
youthful
ardour
had
firmly
resolved
to
lay
the
foundation
at
least
of
a
secure
livelihood
during
the
next
three
or
four
year
and
saving
up
a
certain
sum
to
emigrate
to
siberia
a
country
rich
in
every
natural
resource
and
in
need
of
worker
active
men
and
capital
there
they
would
settle
in
the
town
where
rodya
wa
and
all
together
would
begin
a
new
life
they
all
wept
at
parting
raskolnikov
had
been
very
dreamy
for
a
few
day
before
he
asked
a
great
deal
about
his
mother
and
wa
constantly
anxious
about
her
he
worried
so
much
about
her
that
it
alarmed
dounia
when
he
heard
about
his
mother
s
illness
he
became
very
gloomy
with
sonia
he
wa
particularly
reserved
all
the
time
with
the
help
of
the
money
left
to
her
by
svidrigaïlov
sonia
had
long
ago
made
her
preparation
to
follow
the
party
of
convict
in
which
he
wa
despatched
to
siberia
not
a
word
passed
between
raskolnikov
and
her
on
the
subject
but
both
knew
it
would
be
so
at
the
final
he
smiled
strangely
at
his
sister
s
and
razumihin
s
fervent
anticipation
of
their
happy
future
together
when
he
should
come
out
of
prison
he
predicted
that
their
mother
s
illness
would
soon
have
a
fatal
ending
sonia
and
he
at
last
set
off
two
month
later
dounia
wa
married
to
razumihin
it
wa
a
quiet
and
sorrowful
wedding
porfiry
petrovitch
and
zossimov
were
invited
however
during
all
this
period
razumihin
wore
an
air
of
resolute
determination
dounia
put
implicit
faith
in
his
carrying
out
his
plan
and
indeed
she
could
not
but
believe
in
him
he
displayed
a
rare
strength
of
will
among
other
thing
he
began
attending
university
lecture
again
in
order
to
take
his
degree
they
were
continually
making
plan
for
the
future
both
counted
on
settling
in
siberia
within
five
year
at
least
till
then
they
rested
their
hope
on
sonia
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
delighted
to
give
her
blessing
to
dounia
s
marriage
with
razumihin
but
after
the
marriage
she
became
even
more
melancholy
and
anxious
to
give
her
pleasure
razumihin
told
her
how
raskolnikov
had
looked
after
the
poor
student
and
his
decrepit
father
and
how
a
year
ago
he
had
been
burnt
and
injured
in
rescuing
two
little
child
from
a
fire
these
two
piece
of
news
excited
pulcheria
alexandrovna
s
disordered
imagination
almost
to
ecstasy
she
wa
continually
talking
about
them
even
entering
into
conversation
with
stranger
in
the
street
though
dounia
always
accompanied
her
in
public
conveyance
and
shop
wherever
she
could
capture
a
listener
she
would
begin
the
discourse
about
her
son
his
article
how
he
had
helped
the
student
how
he
had
been
burnt
at
the
fire
and
so
on
dounia
did
not
know
how
to
restrain
her
apart
from
the
danger
of
her
morbid
excitement
there
wa
the
risk
of
someone
s
recalling
raskolnikov
s
name
and
speaking
of
the
recent
trial
pulcheria
alexandrovna
found
out
the
address
of
the
mother
of
the
two
child
her
son
had
saved
and
insisted
on
going
to
see
her
at
last
her
restlessness
reached
an
extreme
point
she
would
sometimes
begin
to
cry
suddenly
and
wa
often
ill
and
feverishly
delirious
one
morning
she
declared
that
by
her
reckoning
rodya
ought
soon
to
be
home
that
she
remembered
when
he
said
to
her
he
said
that
they
must
expect
him
back
in
nine
month
she
began
to
prepare
for
his
coming
began
to
do
up
her
room
for
him
to
clean
the
furniture
to
wash
and
put
up
new
hanging
and
so
on
dounia
wa
anxious
but
said
nothing
and
helped
her
to
arrange
the
room
after
a
fatiguing
day
spent
in
continual
fancy
in
joyful
and
tear
pulcheria
alexandrovna
wa
taken
ill
in
the
night
and
by
morning
she
wa
feverish
and
delirious
it
wa
brain
fever
she
died
within
a
fortnight
in
her
delirium
she
dropped
word
which
showed
that
she
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
her
son
s
terrible
fate
than
they
had
supposed
for
a
long
time
raskolnikov
did
not
know
of
his
mother
s
death
though
a
regular
correspondence
had
been
maintained
from
the
time
he
reached
siberia
it
wa
carried
on
by
mean
of
sonia
who
wrote
every
month
to
the
razumihins
and
received
an
answer
with
unfailing
regularity
at
first
they
found
sonia
s
letter
dry
and
unsatisfactory
but
later
on
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
letter
could
not
be
better
for
from
these
letter
they
received
a
complete
picture
of
their
unfortunate
brother
s
life
sonia
s
letter
were
full
of
the
most
detail
the
simplest
and
clearest
description
of
all
raskolnikov
s
surroundings
a
a
convict
there
wa
no
word
of
her
own
hope
no
conjecture
a
to
the
future
no
description
of
her
feeling
instead
of
any
attempt
to
interpret
his
state
of
mind
and
inner
life
she
gave
the
simple
fact
that
is
his
own
word
an
exact
account
of
his
health
what
he
asked
for
at
their
interview
what
commission
he
gave
her
and
so
on
all
these
fact
she
gave
with
extraordinary
minuteness
the
picture
of
their
unhappy
brother
stood
out
at
last
with
great
clearness
and
precision
there
could
be
no
mistake
because
nothing
wa
given
but
fact
but
dounia
and
her
husband
could
get
little
comfort
out
of
the
news
especially
at
first
sonia
wrote
that
he
wa
constantly
sullen
and
not
ready
to
talk
that
he
scarcely
seemed
interested
in
the
news
she
gave
him
from
their
letter
that
he
sometimes
asked
after
his
mother
and
that
when
seeing
that
he
had
guessed
the
truth
she
told
him
at
last
of
her
death
she
wa
surprised
to
find
that
he
did
not
seem
greatly
affected
by
it
not
externally
at
any
rate
she
told
them
that
although
he
seemed
so
wrapped
up
in
himself
and
a
it
were
shut
himself
off
from
everyone
he
took
a
very
direct
and
simple
view
of
his
new
life
that
he
understood
his
position
expected
nothing
better
for
the
time
had
no
hope
a
is
so
common
in
his
position
and
scarcely
seemed
surprised
at
anything
in
his
surroundings
so
unlike
anything
he
had
known
before
she
wrote
that
his
health
wa
satisfactory
he
did
his
work
without
shirking
or
seeking
to
do
more
he
wa
almost
indifferent
about
food
but
except
on
sunday
and
holiday
the
food
wa
so
bad
that
at
last
he
had
been
glad
to
accept
some
money
from
her
sonia
to
have
his
own
tea
every
day
he
begged
her
not
to
trouble
about
anything
else
declaring
that
all
this
fuss
about
him
only
annoyed
him
sonia
wrote
further
that
in
prison
he
shared
the
same
room
with
the
rest
that
she
had
not
seen
the
inside
of
their
barrack
but
concluded
that
they
were
crowded
miserable
and
unhealthy
that
he
slept
on
a
plank
bed
with
a
rug
under
him
and
wa
unwilling
to
make
any
other
arrangement
but
that
he
lived
so
poorly
and
roughly
not
from
any
plan
or
design
but
simply
from
inattention
and
indifference
sonia
wrote
simply
that
he
had
at
first
shown
no
interest
in
her
visit
had
almost
been
vexed
with
her
indeed
for
coming
unwilling
to
talk
and
rude
to
her
but
that
in
the
end
these
visit
had
become
a
habit
and
almost
a
necessity
for
him
so
that
he
wa
positively
distressed
when
she
wa
ill
for
some
day
and
could
not
visit
him
she
used
to
see
him
on
holiday
at
the
prison
gate
or
in
the
to
which
he
wa
brought
for
a
few
minute
to
see
her
on
working
day
she
would
go
to
see
him
at
work
either
at
the
workshop
or
at
the
brick
kiln
or
at
the
shed
on
the
bank
of
the
irtish
about
herself
sonia
wrote
that
she
had
succeeded
in
making
some
acquaintance
in
the
town
that
she
did
sewing
and
a
there
wa
scarcely
a
dressmaker
in
the
town
she
wa
looked
upon
a
an
indispensable
person
in
many
house
but
she
did
not
mention
that
the
authority
were
through
her
interested
in
raskolnikov
that
his
task
wa
lightened
and
so
on
at
last
the
news
came
dounia
had
indeed
noticed
sign
of
alarm
and
uneasiness
in
the
preceding
letter
that
he
held
aloof
from
everyone
that
his
fellow
prisoner
did
not
like
him
that
he
kept
silent
for
day
at
a
time
and
wa
becoming
very
pale
in
the
last
letter
sonia
wrote
that
he
had
been
taken
very
seriously
ill
and
wa
in
the
convict
ward
of
the
hospital
ii
he
wa
ill
a
long
time
but
it
wa
not
the
horror
of
prison
life
not
the
hard
labour
the
bad
food
the
shaven
head
or
the
patched
clothes
that
crushed
him
what
did
he
care
for
all
those
trial
and
hardship
he
wa
even
glad
of
the
hard
work
physically
exhausted
he
could
at
least
reckon
on
a
few
hour
of
quiet
sleep
and
what
wa
the
food
to
him
the
thin
cabbage
soup
with
beetle
floating
in
it
in
the
past
a
a
student
he
had
often
not
had
even
that
his
clothes
were
warm
and
suited
to
his
manner
of
life
he
did
not
even
feel
the
fetter
wa
he
ashamed
of
his
shaven
head
and
coat
before
whom
before
sonia
sonia
wa
afraid
of
him
how
could
he
be
ashamed
before
her
and
yet
he
wa
ashamed
even
before
sonia
whom
he
tortured
because
of
it
with
his
contemptuous
rough
manner
but
it
wa
not
his
shaven
head
and
his
fetter
he
wa
ashamed
of
his
pride
had
been
stung
to
the
quick
it
wa
wounded
pride
that
made
him
oh
how
happy
he
would
have
been
if
he
could
have
blamed
himself
he
could
have
borne
anything
then
even
shame
and
disgrace
but
he
judged
himself
severely
and
his
exasperated
conscience
found
no
particularly
terrible
fault
in
his
past
except
a
simple
which
might
happen
to
anyone
he
wa
ashamed
just
because
he
raskolnikov
had
so
hopelessly
stupidly
come
to
grief
through
some
decree
of
blind
fate
and
must
humble
himself
and
submit
to
the
idiocy
of
a
sentence
if
he
were
anyhow
to
be
at
peace
vague
and
objectless
anxiety
in
the
present
and
in
the
future
a
continual
sacrifice
leading
to
nothing
that
wa
all
that
lay
before
him
and
what
comfort
wa
it
to
him
that
at
the
end
of
eight
year
he
would
only
be
and
able
to
begin
a
new
life
what
had
he
to
live
for
what
had
he
to
look
forward
to
why
should
he
strive
to
live
in
order
to
exist
why
he
had
been
ready
a
thousand
time
before
to
give
up
existence
for
the
sake
of
an
idea
for
a
hope
even
for
a
fancy
mere
existence
had
always
been
too
little
for
him
he
had
always
wanted
more
perhaps
it
wa
just
because
of
the
strength
of
his
desire
that
he
had
thought
himself
a
man
to
whom
more
wa
permissible
than
to
others
and
if
only
fate
would
have
sent
him
repentance
burning
repentance
that
would
have
torn
his
heart
and
robbed
him
of
sleep
that
repentance
the
awful
agony
of
which
brings
vision
of
hanging
or
drowning
oh
he
would
have
been
glad
of
it
tear
and
agony
would
at
least
have
been
life
but
he
did
not
repent
of
his
crime
at
least
he
might
have
found
relief
in
raging
at
his
stupidity
a
he
had
raged
at
the
grotesque
blunder
that
had
brought
him
to
prison
but
now
in
prison
he
thought
over
and
criticised
all
his
action
again
and
by
no
mean
found
them
so
blundering
and
so
grotesque
a
they
had
seemed
at
the
fatal
time
in
what
way
he
asked
himself
wa
my
theory
stupider
than
others
that
have
swarmed
and
clashed
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
one
ha
only
to
look
at
the
thing
quite
independently
broadly
and
uninfluenced
by
commonplace
idea
and
my
idea
will
by
no
mean
seem
so
strange
oh
sceptic
and
halfpenny
philosopher
why
do
you
halt
why
doe
my
action
strike
them
a
so
horrible
he
said
to
himself
is
it
because
it
wa
a
crime
what
is
meant
by
crime
my
conscience
is
at
rest
of
course
it
wa
a
legal
crime
of
course
the
letter
of
the
law
wa
broken
and
blood
wa
shed
well
punish
me
for
the
letter
of
the
law
and
that
s
enough
of
course
in
that
case
many
of
the
benefactor
of
mankind
who
snatched
power
for
themselves
instead
of
inheriting
it
ought
to
have
been
punished
at
their
first
step
but
those
men
succeeded
and
so
were
and
i
didn
t
and
so
i
had
no
right
to
have
taken
that
it
wa
only
in
that
that
he
recognised
his
criminality
only
in
the
fact
that
he
had
been
unsuccessful
and
had
confessed
it
he
suffered
too
from
the
question
why
had
he
not
killed
himself
why
had
he
stood
looking
at
the
river
and
preferred
to
confess
wa
the
desire
to
live
so
strong
and
wa
it
so
hard
to
overcome
it
had
not
svidrigaïlov
overcome
it
although
he
wa
afraid
of
death
in
misery
he
asked
himself
this
question
and
could
not
understand
that
at
the
very
time
he
had
been
standing
looking
into
the
river
he
had
perhaps
been
dimly
conscious
of
the
fundamental
falsity
in
himself
and
his
conviction
he
didn
t
understand
that
that
consciousness
might
be
the
promise
of
a
future
crisis
of
a
new
view
of
life
and
of
his
future
resurrection
he
preferred
to
attribute
it
to
the
dead
weight
of
instinct
which
he
could
not
step
over
again
through
weakness
and
meanness
he
looked
at
his
fellow
prisoner
and
wa
amazed
to
see
how
they
all
loved
life
and
prized
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
loved
and
valued
life
more
in
prison
than
in
freedom
what
terrible
agony
and
privation
some
of
them
the
tramp
for
instance
had
endured
could
they
care
so
much
for
a
ray
of
sunshine
for
the
primeval
forest
the
cold
spring
hidden
away
in
some
unseen
spot
which
the
tramp
had
marked
three
year
before
and
longed
to
see
again
a
he
might
to
see
his
sweetheart
dreaming
of
the
green
grass
round
it
and
the
bird
singing
in
the
bush
a
he
went
on
he
saw
still
more
inexplicable
example
in
prison
of
course
there
wa
a
great
deal
he
did
not
see
and
did
not
want
to
see
he
lived
a
it
were
with
downcast
eye
it
wa
loathsome
and
unbearable
for
him
to
look
but
in
the
end
there
wa
much
that
surprised
him
and
he
began
a
it
were
involuntarily
to
notice
much
that
he
had
not
suspected
before
what
surprised
him
most
of
all
wa
the
terrible
impossible
gulf
that
lay
between
him
and
all
the
rest
they
seemed
to
be
a
different
specie
and
he
looked
at
them
and
they
at
him
with
distrust
and
hostility
he
felt
and
knew
the
reason
of
his
isolation
but
he
would
never
have
admitted
till
then
that
those
reason
were
so
deep
and
strong
there
were
some
polish
exile
political
prisoner
among
them
they
simply
looked
down
upon
all
the
rest
a
ignorant
churl
but
raskolnikov
could
not
look
upon
them
like
that
he
saw
that
these
ignorant
men
were
in
many
respect
far
wiser
than
the
pole
there
were
some
russian
who
were
just
a
contemptuous
a
former
officer
and
two
seminarist
raskolnikov
saw
their
mistake
a
clearly
he
wa
disliked
and
avoided
by
everyone
they
even
began
to
hate
him
at
last
why
he
could
not
tell
men
who
had
been
far
more
guilty
despised
and
laughed
at
his
crime
you
re
a
gentleman
they
used
to
say
you
shouldn
t
hack
about
with
an
axe
that
s
not
a
gentleman
s
the
second
week
in
lent
his
turn
came
to
take
the
sacrament
with
his
gang
he
went
to
church
and
prayed
with
the
others
a
quarrel
broke
out
one
day
he
did
not
know
how
all
fell
on
him
at
once
in
a
fury
you
re
an
infidel
you
don
t
believe
in
god
they
shouted
you
ought
to
be
he
had
never
talked
to
them
about
god
nor
his
belief
but
they
wanted
to
kill
him
a
an
infidel
he
said
nothing
one
of
the
prisoner
rushed
at
him
in
a
perfect
frenzy
raskolnikov
awaited
him
calmly
and
silently
his
eyebrow
did
not
quiver
his
face
did
not
flinch
the
guard
succeeded
in
intervening
between
him
and
his
assailant
or
there
would
have
been
bloodshed
there
wa
another
question
he
could
not
decide
why
were
they
all
so
fond
of
sonia
she
did
not
try
to
win
their
favour
she
rarely
met
them
sometimes
only
she
came
to
see
him
at
work
for
a
moment
and
yet
everybody
knew
her
they
knew
that
she
had
come
out
to
follow
knew
how
and
where
she
lived
she
never
gave
them
money
did
them
no
particular
service
only
once
at
christmas
she
sent
them
all
present
of
pie
and
roll
but
by
degree
closer
relation
sprang
up
between
them
and
sonia
she
would
write
and
post
letter
for
them
to
their
relation
relation
of
the
prisoner
who
visited
the
town
at
their
instruction
left
with
sonia
present
and
money
for
them
their
wife
and
sweetheart
knew
her
and
used
to
visit
her
and
when
she
visited
raskolnikov
at
work
or
met
a
party
of
the
prisoner
on
the
road
they
all
took
off
their
hat
to
her
little
mother
sofya
semyonovna
you
are
our
dear
good
little
mother
coarse
branded
criminal
said
to
that
frail
little
creature
she
would
smile
and
bow
to
them
and
everyone
wa
delighted
when
she
smiled
they
even
admired
her
gait
and
turned
round
to
watch
her
walking
they
admired
her
too
for
being
so
little
and
in
fact
did
not
know
what
to
admire
her
most
for
they
even
came
to
her
for
help
in
their
illness
he
wa
in
the
hospital
from
the
middle
of
lent
till
after
easter
when
he
wa
better
he
remembered
the
dream
he
had
had
while
he
wa
feverish
and
delirious
he
dreamt
that
the
whole
world
wa
condemned
to
a
terrible
new
strange
plague
that
had
come
to
europe
from
the
depth
of
asia
all
were
to
be
destroyed
except
a
very
few
chosen
some
new
sort
of
microbe
were
attacking
the
body
of
men
but
these
microbe
were
endowed
with
intelligence
and
will
men
attacked
by
them
became
at
once
mad
and
furious
but
never
had
men
considered
themselves
so
intellectual
and
so
completely
in
possession
of
the
truth
a
these
sufferer
never
had
they
considered
their
decision
their
scientific
conclusion
their
moral
conviction
so
infallible
whole
village
whole
town
and
people
went
mad
from
the
infection
all
were
excited
and
did
not
understand
one
another
each
thought
that
he
alone
had
the
truth
and
wa
wretched
looking
at
the
others
beat
himself
on
the
breast
wept
and
wrung
his
hand
they
did
not
know
how
to
judge
and
could
not
agree
what
to
consider
evil
and
what
good
they
did
not
know
whom
to
blame
whom
to
justify
men
killed
each
other
in
a
sort
of
senseless
spite
they
gathered
together
in
army
against
one
another
but
even
on
the
march
the
army
would
begin
attacking
each
other
the
rank
would
be
broken
and
the
soldier
would
fall
on
each
other
stabbing
and
cutting
biting
and
devouring
each
other
the
alarm
bell
wa
ringing
all
day
long
in
the
town
men
rushed
together
but
why
they
were
summoned
and
who
wa
summoning
them
no
one
knew
the
most
ordinary
trade
were
abandoned
because
everyone
proposed
his
own
idea
his
own
improvement
and
they
could
not
agree
the
land
too
wa
abandoned
men
met
in
group
agreed
on
something
swore
to
keep
together
but
at
once
began
on
something
quite
different
from
what
they
had
proposed
they
accused
one
another
fought
and
killed
each
other
there
were
conflagration
and
famine
all
men
and
all
thing
were
involved
in
destruction
the
plague
spread
and
moved
further
and
further
only
a
few
men
could
be
saved
in
the
whole
world
they
were
a
pure
chosen
people
destined
to
found
a
new
race
and
a
new
life
to
renew
and
purify
the
earth
but
no
one
had
seen
these
men
no
one
had
heard
their
word
and
their
voice
raskolnikov
wa
worried
that
this
senseless
dream
haunted
his
memory
so
miserably
the
impression
of
this
feverish
delirium
persisted
so
long
the
second
week
after
easter
had
come
there
were
warm
bright
spring
day
in
the
prison
ward
the
grating
window
under
which
the
sentinel
paced
were
opened
sonia
had
only
been
able
to
visit
him
twice
during
his
illness
each
time
she
had
to
obtain
permission
and
it
wa
difficult
but
she
often
used
to
come
to
the
hospital
yard
especially
in
the
evening
sometimes
only
to
stand
a
minute
and
look
up
at
the
window
of
the
ward
one
evening
when
he
wa
almost
well
again
raskolnikov
fell
asleep
on
waking
up
he
chanced
to
go
to
the
window
and
at
once
saw
sonia
in
the
distance
at
the
hospital
gate
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
someone
something
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
at
that
minute
he
shuddered
and
moved
away
from
the
window
next
day
sonia
did
not
come
nor
the
day
after
he
noticed
that
he
wa
expecting
her
uneasily
at
last
he
wa
discharged
on
reaching
the
prison
he
learnt
from
the
convict
that
sofya
semyonovna
wa
lying
ill
at
home
and
wa
unable
to
go
out
he
wa
very
uneasy
and
sent
to
inquire
after
her
he
soon
learnt
that
her
illness
wa
not
dangerous
hearing
that
he
wa
anxious
about
her
sonia
sent
him
a
pencilled
note
telling
him
that
she
wa
much
better
that
she
had
a
slight
cold
and
that
she
would
soon
very
soon
come
and
see
him
at
his
work
his
heart
throbbed
painfully
a
he
read
it
again
it
wa
a
warm
bright
day
early
in
the
morning
at
six
o
clock
he
went
off
to
work
on
the
river
bank
where
they
used
to
pound
alabaster
and
where
there
wa
a
kiln
for
baking
it
in
a
shed
there
were
only
three
of
them
sent
one
of
the
convict
went
with
the
guard
to
the
fortress
to
fetch
a
tool
the
other
began
getting
the
wood
ready
and
laying
it
in
the
kiln
raskolnikov
came
out
of
the
shed
on
to
the
river
bank
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
log
by
the
shed
and
began
gazing
at
the
wide
deserted
river
from
the
high
bank
a
broad
landscape
opened
before
him
the
sound
of
singing
floated
faintly
audible
from
the
other
bank
in
the
vast
steppe
bathed
in
sunshine
he
could
just
see
like
black
speck
the
nomad
tent
there
there
wa
freedom
there
other
men
were
living
utterly
unlike
those
here
there
time
itself
seemed
to
stand
still
a
though
the
age
of
abraham
and
his
flock
had
not
passed
raskolnikov
sat
gazing
his
thought
passed
into
into
contemplation
he
thought
of
nothing
but
a
vague
restlessness
excited
and
troubled
him
suddenly
he
found
sonia
beside
him
she
had
come
up
noiselessly
and
sat
down
at
his
side
it
wa
still
quite
early
the
morning
chill
wa
still
keen
she
wore
her
poor
old
burnous
and
the
green
shawl
her
face
still
showed
sign
of
illness
it
wa
thinner
and
paler
she
gave
him
a
joyful
smile
of
welcome
but
held
out
her
hand
with
her
usual
timidity
she
wa
always
timid
of
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
and
sometimes
did
not
offer
it
at
all
a
though
afraid
he
would
repel
it
he
always
took
her
hand
a
though
with
repugnance
always
seemed
vexed
to
meet
her
and
wa
sometimes
obstinately
silent
throughout
her
visit
sometimes
she
trembled
before
him
and
went
away
deeply
grieved
but
now
their
hand
did
not
part
he
stole
a
rapid
glance
at
her
and
dropped
his
eye
on
the
ground
without
speaking
they
were
alone
no
one
had
seen
them
the
guard
had
turned
away
for
the
time
how
it
happened
he
did
not
know
but
all
at
once
something
seemed
to
seize
him
and
fling
him
at
her
foot
he
wept
and
threw
his
arm
round
her
knee
for
the
first
instant
she
wa
terribly
frightened
and
she
turned
pale
she
jumped
up
and
looked
at
him
trembling
but
at
the
same
moment
she
understood
and
a
light
of
infinite
happiness
came
into
her
eye
she
knew
and
had
no
doubt
that
he
loved
her
beyond
everything
and
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
they
wanted
to
speak
but
could
not
tear
stood
in
their
eye
they
were
both
pale
and
thin
but
those
sick
pale
face
were
bright
with
the
dawn
of
a
new
future
of
a
full
resurrection
into
a
new
life
they
were
renewed
by
love
the
heart
of
each
held
infinite
source
of
life
for
the
heart
of
the
other
they
resolved
to
wait
and
be
patient
they
had
another
seven
year
to
wait
and
what
terrible
suffering
and
what
infinite
happiness
before
them
but
he
had
risen
again
and
he
knew
it
and
felt
it
in
all
his
being
while
she
she
only
lived
in
his
life
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
when
the
barrack
were
locked
raskolnikov
lay
on
his
plank
bed
and
thought
of
her
he
had
even
fancied
that
day
that
all
the
convict
who
had
been
his
enemy
looked
at
him
differently
he
had
even
entered
into
talk
with
them
and
they
answered
him
in
a
friendly
way
he
remembered
that
now
and
thought
it
wa
bound
to
be
so
wasn
t
everything
now
bound
to
be
changed
he
thought
of
her
he
remembered
how
continually
he
had
tormented
her
and
wounded
her
heart
he
remembered
her
pale
and
thin
little
face
but
these
recollection
scarcely
troubled
him
now
he
knew
with
what
infinite
love
he
would
now
repay
all
her
suffering
and
what
were
all
the
agony
of
the
past
everything
even
his
crime
his
sentence
and
imprisonment
seemed
to
him
now
in
the
first
rush
of
feeling
an
external
strange
fact
with
which
he
had
no
concern
but
he
could
not
think
for
long
together
of
anything
that
evening
and
he
could
not
have
analysed
anything
consciously
he
wa
simply
feeling
life
had
stepped
into
the
place
of
theory
and
something
quite
different
would
work
itself
out
in
his
mind
under
his
pillow
lay
the
new
testament
he
took
it
up
mechanically
the
book
belonged
to
sonia
it
wa
the
one
from
which
she
had
read
the
raising
of
lazarus
to
him
at
first
he
wa
afraid
that
she
would
worry
him
about
religion
would
talk
about
the
gospel
and
pester
him
with
book
but
to
his
great
surprise
she
had
not
once
approached
the
subject
and
had
not
even
offered
him
the
testament
he
had
asked
her
for
it
himself
not
long
before
his
illness
and
she
brought
him
the
book
without
a
word
till
now
he
had
not
opened
it
he
did
not
open
it
now
but
one
thought
passed
through
his
mind
can
her
conviction
not
be
mine
now
her
feeling
her
aspiration
at
least
she
too
had
been
greatly
agitated
that
day
and
at
night
she
wa
taken
ill
again
but
she
wa
so
happy
and
so
unexpectedly
happy
that
she
wa
almost
frightened
of
her
happiness
seven
year
seven
year
at
the
beginning
of
their
happiness
at
some
moment
they
were
both
ready
to
look
on
those
seven
year
a
though
they
were
seven
day
he
did
not
know
that
the
new
life
would
not
be
given
him
for
nothing
that
he
would
have
to
pay
dearly
for
it
that
it
would
cost
him
great
striving
great
suffering
but
that
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
story
the
story
of
the
gradual
renewal
of
a
man
the
story
of
his
gradual
regeneration
of
his
passing
from
one
world
into
another
of
his
initiation
into
a
new
unknown
life
that
might
be
the
subject
of
a
new
story
but
our
present
story
is
ended
